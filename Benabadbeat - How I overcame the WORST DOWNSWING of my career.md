Ben felt during the lowest of his downswing, what happens if i lose another 100,000$, am i going to quit, how am i going to justify it to myself, what are people going to think. He thought about it and came up with two options:

1. Take a long break/quite
2. Dig deep

He was able to find option 2 thx to his poker friends (strong players) supporting him emotionally.

He kept asking himself, how many more people could endure this?

When he had "mini-downswings" it kept throwing him off to the huge downswing he experienced.
