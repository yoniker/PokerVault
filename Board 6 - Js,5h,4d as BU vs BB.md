## Flop

When checked to, BU bets at some frequency almost everything but A8-AT,
higher frequencies to overpairs, sets,  jx, hands that bet the least are broadway of clubs which means no backdoor flush

On the flop, AKo and 5x hands actually bet a lot as the BU, and 66-88 bet more than 99-TT. Protection is a realy thing on this flop.

## Turn

After betting a hand like A7o on the flop, if I "get there" on the turn, very rarely continue betting - a second pair is rarely worth 3 streets...on the river if BB check, I can sometimes get thin value

After betting the flop small, overpairs like KK/QQ overbet the turn on blank disconnected turns like 9/8/T (AA slowplay more)
