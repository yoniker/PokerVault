## Flop



## Turn

After flop goes X/X, I want to lead sometimes with Jx, redraws to straights or good kickers are betting more often than Jx with no kicker or redraw

Hands that lead bluff are for example As-X when the second spade comes (as I block his nut flush draws), for example A8 bluffs a lot or pure when the 8 is also a gutshot/OESD, and bluffs infrequent if it's just Aspades

## River

Blank turn, I have QJ, I bet the turn he calls, on a blank river I always(!) bet it.
