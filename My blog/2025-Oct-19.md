Study poker targets were: Minimum 7 hours  Target 10 hours  Outrageous - 14 hours

Actual 10.5 hours (between target and outrageous).

This week I've lost a few buy ins (account about $1860) in a spectacular fashion, even for online.
Will take this opportunity to vent a bit, just because the way shit went down, will be amusing to you :D I promise not to complain too much when going through negative stretches.

OK So... after running KK in AA 3 times in the same session, this hand happened when I ran AA into KK (HAHAHAHA):

The poker gods say: "Today we hate you, WhiteIvey" :D
a session or 2 after, this hand: [https://gg.gl/kbdav](https://gg.gl/kbdav)

Now, I know that the definition of playing tilted is "Playing differently than I would without the emotion being present", which applies to both negative and positive emotions. I'm not going to do that. What I'm going to do this week though, is to play WAY WAY more online, same style, as long as I'm focused. In fact, from tmw I will do a 50k hands sample and share the results here.
Also I want, of course, to keep study.
