## Original targets: 

Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Online poker: Minimum 3 hours

Actual: Study poker- 7.5 hours (between Target and outrageous). 
To be transparent, this includes only grinding GTOW and putting notes in my vault, it doesn't include the crazy amount of time time I spent on anki, watching videos and more.
If we did include those then this week would have been easily at the 20h+ mark for studying.

Play poker- I didn't measure the time, about 4 hours - that's pretty bad - but I will improve significantly on that.


## Changes
Following the shocking interview by mechanics of poker, where Yolen share that he:
1. Studied poker in a vaccum for 2 years (8 hours a day regime to begin with)
2. Didn't beat NL50 after those 2 years
with the exact quotes:

Studying-performance gap in poker
Why is studying the theory doesn't make you instantly a better poker player?
Because poker is like a language: If I only study it in theory and try to speak it I will not do well,too many areas which need to be practiced in a game to perform better, if I only study I will have a lot of information in my head, but I wouldn't know what to choose in real time.
