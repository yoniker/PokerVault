## Original targets: 

Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Online poker: Minimum 3 hours

Actual: Study poker- 7.5 hours (between Target and outrageous). 
To be transparent, this includes only grinding GTOW and putting notes in my vault, it doesn't include the crazy amount of time time I spent on anki, watching videos and more.
If we did include those then this week would have been easily at the 20h+ mark for studying.

Play poker- I didn't measure the time, about 4 hours - that's pretty bad - but I will improve significantly on that. more on that later

## Interesting hands:
https://gg.gl/nfpyl I think that  OTR he's never betting AQ/KQ for this sizing so this might be a trivial call.

Embarrassing hand: 2/5 live, I flat AQhh  vs early aggrofish $25 open, BU also calls. Flop 7h4h4c af goes $75, I call BU calls. Turn Qd af goes $250, I have $660 behind, and made the blunder of shoving. I won the hand but this blunder really hurt me in real time. It happened as I can't think clearly in big pots still. Should take more time in bigger pots, and ask some basic questions before I ask. All I remember is me thinking - ok i'm not folding this - without any other thoughts put into the process-need to fix this.


## Changes
Following the shocking interview by mechanics of poker, where Yolen share that he:
1. Studied poker in a vaccum for 2 years (8 hours a day regime to begin with)
2. Didn't beat NL50 after those 2 years
Or the longer version:

He studied GTO for 2.5 years without playing, thought he will develop an edge by just having a theoretical knowledge, and yet lost money as soon as he started playing NL50, "Poker is the only discipline where you can put a lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work"

Studying-performance gap in poker
Why is studying the theory doesn't make you instantly a better poker player?
Because poker is like a language: If I only study it in theory and try to speak it I will not do well,too many areas which need to be practiced in a game to perform better, if I only study I will have a lot of information in my head, but I wouldn't know what to choose in real time.

This honestly kind of shocked me, and this is the time to act before I will re-discover, like Yolen, that studying in a vaccum isn't sufficient.  Therefore, from now on, playing online poker will be an integral part of my deliberate practice cycle, and will be called "hunt sessions", as I will 'hunt' for boards that are similar to what I've just practice in a vaccum. I will be more specific:

## Hunt Sessions: Closing the Deliberate Practice Loop

After studying a board, I immediately play a A-game, one table, R&C table ,60-minute session hunting for similar boards. If I studied 9s 7h 4d, I hunt all "Disconnected Rainbow" boards.

I tag these hands and check: Did I actually apply what I learned? 

As much as I love studying in a vaccum, I don't want to waste my time like Yolen did. 
Any hand from a hunt session that I'm unsure of, will be reviewed deeply:

## Deep hand review - defined

For each spot I'm unsure of, answer the following questions:

1. What 2 bet sizes are used the most here? What parts of villain's range am I making indifferent with those 2 sizes?

  
  

2. Global frequencies: BU's range frequencies (fold/call/bet(or raise)).

  
  

3. Local frequencies: How often does a specific hand class bet/folds/calls? Eg what’s the bet/check frequencies for flush? Top pair? Air?.

  
  

4. What hands, if any, are pure strategy? (eg always do a specific action and not mixing or hardly mixing eg almost one color in GTOW).

  
  

5. What are the threshold hands? eg strongest hand I fold/ weakest hand I call? the strongest hand I bluff? Weakest raise hand for each bet size?

  
6. (Optional) Pick some interesting combos and guess what I’d do with those, what hands are the best bluffs and at what frequency

Bonus: For each of those questions add - what's my preception of humans in this spot? For example, if humans need to bluff for 2x pot frequently with air on a spot, and I don't think this is happening, this implies that ALL hands that are indifferent between call/fold, are pure folds.

From this day onwards, hunt session and deep review will be an integral part of my study time, and will count as much as drilling time. There's no more seperate drilling/play online/review hands. It's all part of one system.
