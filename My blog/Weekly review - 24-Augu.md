Weekly review- 24-aug:

Targets were : M/T/O: 5,7,10
Actual: 6(between minimum and actual) - to be fair, this does not include the 3-4 hours I spent answering my anki cards at the gym when I'm on the treadmill.

Another bad week - lost 5 buy ins.
It's mostly been coolers (KK preflop vs AQs all in and I lost, Ts8s top two+fd -got it in vs mid set on Td8d5s7s where I'm ahead of some of his value and he has tons of combo draws, 66 set got it in vs KK on the turn and he rivered a K (two outs baby- and I didn't even get a ggcheers even on a dry board!)) but it still sucks. 

The only stack I've lost and could do sth about is this:

where I think I can and should find the fold on the turn. Because looking an actual 10NL x/r range, I have at most 7 outs most of the time. He went huge when the flush came- I don't need to be a genius, MDA expert, or Linus to understand what he has.
And river call was a pure pure torching of the money.

So, running bad, and playing bad, I got a step closer to move down to NL5, BR at $1301, and will move down at $1050. I hope it doesn't come to that, but seeing that BR was already at $1750, well, it seems like a real possibility now.

## A little something
My main issues are autopiloting and nutsophobia. To combat both effectively, think clearer while playing and training, a question I will *ALWAYS* ask from now on, is "What part of his/my range is indifferent for this action?". I started training with it for the last couple of days, but I think this alone will shut down any possibility of auto-piloting.



Targets for this week: M/T/O: 5,7,10
Have a great week everyone!
