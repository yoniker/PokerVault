Weekly targets were:
Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Actual: Study poker- 4  hours (less than the minimum).
For the first time, I've studied less than the minimum I set for myself. 
For personal reasons, took a vacation mid-week, and I came back tired af.

Online bankroll increased by 3.5 buy ins but this is how (lol):

Targets for this week:
Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Hopefully, I will get back on track. I'm far off from where I want to be - in terms of process.
