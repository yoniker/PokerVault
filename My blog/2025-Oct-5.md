Weekly targets were:
Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Actual: Study poker- 7  hours (exactly target).

I've been building good habit this week (study for an hour as soon as I wake up, then gym-even on days off).

Won a few buy ins thx to ggcheers (bankroll at $1410). Meh.
There's a hand which bothers me until now. Now that I think about it, I need to call at least the turn, if not the river:

If I fold this, it literally means that I fold anything that is not AA/QQ. 
Yes, it won't be fun if he shoves river, but we were not at that point yet, although it seemed likely from all the action. What would you do? Call turn fold to a shove river? Call river too?
