Targets for this week were: M/T/O: 5,7,10
Actual: 5 hours (exactly minimum).
I had a terrible headache for 3 days, which is rare occurrence. Couldn't function in those days so that's why study time went down. 


## 3D Poker

When I started learning how to drive, I acted as if it's a 2D computer game, if it makes sense. So I never turned my head to see what's going on. Embarrassing, right? We live in a 3D world :)

I start to realize that the way I've been studying and playing so far is also 2D. I have some hand, flop is this and that, my range's global frequency is this, hand class frequency that, specific hand within handclass want to do that a bit more or less. This is the frequency. 2D.
WHAT ABOUT CONSIDERING THE OPPONENT'S RANGE? Poker is a multiplayer game after all :D :D :D

Adding the simple question "What part of his range will become indifferent" while training opened something in my mind. I'm actually considering my opponent's range. I know this will sound basic and silly to you crushers, but this is truly an amazing oversight by me.

Targets for this week : M/T/O: 5,7,10

Have a healthy week everyone :)
