Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
Actual: Study poker- 3.5  hours (Less than the minimum)

I was on a trip for a couple of days, returned tired, and didn't compensate for the hours.
BR went down to $1360 - meh, shit will happen. Wish that I had interesting insights for this week, but I don't. I feel it's okay to miss my target every couple of months.

Targets for this week:
Study poker: Minimum 5 hours  Target 7 hours  Outrageous - 10 hours
