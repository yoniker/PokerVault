Writing a blogpost not on sunday, as this week will not be another regular week, my father was diagnosed with cancer and had an operation, my parents kept this from me and my sisters and so my emotional state won't let me play my A-game until the end of the month,I'm taking those few days until the end of the month to reset emotionally.

This month performance is a very average sample of my results and so now I can explain why I think that moving up to NL25 is not the right choice for me (despite having $2060 + $750(tickets) on my account).

First here's the graph of the hands I've played this month:

So I lost 2BB/100. At the beginning of the month my account balance was $1960 and now it is $2062 with the following sources of income:

Freerolls: 68.99 (WSOP freerolls i made $60, the rest is from daily freerolls)
Rakeback: 15 (I was unfortunate in that respect as fish buffet gave me the lowest option of 10% and then the second lowest)
GGCheers: 17
Leaderboard:4
BBJ:36

In other words, if we take out everything but rakeback, I've lost about 25$ this month.
Despite the lower-volume-than-desired, this is where I stand in poker right now.
Does anyone still think it's proper for me to move up to NL25? Seems to me like I'll simply lose more.
