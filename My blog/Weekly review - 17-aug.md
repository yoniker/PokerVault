Study: Week targets were:  M/T/O 5,7,10, actual: 7 hours (Target).
Rough week, when I lost a few more buy-ins trying new stuff.
I'm still over-bankrolled for NL10 and far away from going down to NL5, but it feels really awful to study this hard and get negative results.


Targets for this week: M/T/O: 5,7,10
