Study poker, goals were: Minimum 7 hours  Target 10 hours  Outrageous - 14 hours

Actual: Just over 7 hours (minimum).

I won like 2 buy ins,meh, but more importantly to the bankroll, I've BINK the flipout tournament, and won 500$ (50 buy ins). Which I'm not going to consider as part of my hardcore bankroll (I'm going to consider it as if it's cashed out), making my current bankroll about $1930.
So, whenever I'll have any positive win rate at NL10, my bankroll already kind of supports NL25 even at the conservative bankroll management of 100 Buy-ins.

On top of that, I got a $150 ticket to Ggmaster so next Sunday will be exciting, hopefully I can make it ITM, but obviously not sth I control.





Target for next week:
Study poker: Minimum 7 hours  Target 10 hours  Outrageous - 14 hours
