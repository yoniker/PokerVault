Meh week. I was unlucky in a few spots (I lost AK vs AA late then 3 mins after chopped with AA vs AK) and ended up being one BI up anyways after the dust settled, which feels great to be honest.  

I should consider the chance that I might be a winning player right now and maybe it's a good idea to play more and try and have a 50k hands sample of wr>=0 as playitsmart suggested here (https://youtu.be/rUNFAmil-_I?t=392) and move up to 25NL. Idk. What feels really awkward is that, if I improved at all, then it's not due to the many hours I spent getting to know GTO shape/thresholds better, but thx to simple exploits like ranging opponents based on bet sizes, timing tells and general HUD stats, as well as 3-betting light vs wide players in late positions and opening very light vs nits, and close to range-betting. 

Feels a bit like a brain-dead poker from my end TBH 🙁

Have a great week everyone!
