## Weekly goals & methodology
Targets I set for this week: Minimum/Target/Outstanding: 5/7/10
Actual performance: 7 hours (exactly target).
While I didn't study as much as a future-high-stakes players did in their prime, not even close, I like the fact that i'm consistent with my morning habit. Every time that I wake up, my first thing is to study poker. From this habit I can easily ramp up. I'm also very happy with the instructions I gave the AI-it's helping me weighting the boards in an optimal way, and does a great job creating the flashcards (with the assets eg I'm seeing an image of Js instead of the text Js, which is closer to "real life").

### Weekly study method
I feel like I want things to sink in, before I'll move to the next configuration (as Ben suggested, this will be a 3B pot), so what i'm going to do for this week (at least,at least until I feel some stuff sank in) is:
1. Drill a specific flop texture family (in a weighted way, eg family 1,high disconnected, will be drilled about half the time for example)-but on all boards rather than the 25 boards
2. Play sessions while focusing on a specific flop texture family (in a weighted way, so again family 1 will be the focus for 50% of the time)
As usual, write every single surprise, confusion, interesting spot etc will be analyzed and be in my Obsidian vault, and automatically make flashcards using AI (Claude).


## Hall of shame
As part of my journey, I should fix leaks in my game. To my understanding my leaks are:

1. Autopiloting
2. Playing scared (folding when I shouldn't, not value betting when I should).
3. Not being able to think clearly in big spots
On this section I'll share hands that I misplayed badly during the week.

### Hand 1
Hand 1 is online:

I think that it's a fold on the river for the following reasons:
When he cold-call the 3-bet preflop, his range is 77-QQ a lot, and maybe some strong suited Ax like ATs AQs. On the river, JJ isn't betting on a Q high board, and I block AQs that bet the turn. In my head, I knew it's going to be TT more than 66% of the time, and I flicked in the call "just to see it"(!!). Kind of autopilot. I think it's a bad call.

### Hand 2
Live 2/5, effective 750$
I open to $15 from UTG, someone who 3-bet a lot from BU 3-bets to $45, bb calls, I 4-bet AQo as a bluff to $145 they both call. I hate life at that point. QJ3 rainbow flop, BB checks, I checked with this hand, fearing the JJ(wtf it's only 3 combos), BU checked. Turn 4, BB goes $145, I call BU folds, two spades. River Ts he goes $375 into the pot that I didn't calculate its size, and i folded. A few mistakes:

1. I can c-bet with value, especially when their range contains only a few better hands than mine
2. I should not fold river anyways, or at least develop a method to think clearly about those spots, and if I fold, it's not because I autopilot-ed or feared irrationally like in this spot, but because I made a calculated decision.

On the bright side, it's good that I started to develop 4-bet bluffs. Even when I get called, I need to consider the facts that I have equity postflop, estimate the situation, and think calmly. Top-top is for sure a great hand for a 4-bet pot with this SPR.


### Hand 3
This hand (probably one of the most embarrassing hands I've ever shared) will demonstrate the extent to which my auto-piloting can go.
I get dealt 72o on BB, UTG (not a tricky limper) limps, SB limp, I check.
Flop 755 X/X/B10$/C/C Pot $45. 
Turn 7 X/X/X
River A, SB bets $25, I think for about it for 3 second before just calling(!!) autopiloting and "thinking" the following:

1. SB will only call with better hands
2. There's a GTO pattern not to raise sth like that one the river, in some other (very different) contexts, and that (irrelevant) piece of information surfaced for a second. It's not an excuse for my poor play- just being honest.
Well, even though it's obvious I will write what is logical:  Am I really worried about A7/55/AA?? My hand deserves a much bigger pot. Raise every single time and let him call with his 88/5x/Ax. I'm ahead of too much of his range to even consider only calling. If there was tons of action previously, only then this GTO wisdom is relevant.

I have huge mental problems (autopiloting is the worst for improvement) that I need to work on - which is great, as this means I have a lot of room for improvement, I'm closer to my floor than I am to my ceiling.


Have a great&productive week everyone!
