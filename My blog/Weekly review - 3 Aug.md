### Hall of shame
As part of my journey, I should leak holes in my game. To my understanding my leaks are:

1. Autopiloting
2. Playing scared (folding when I shouldn't, not value betting when I should).
3. Not being able to think clearly in big spots
On this section I'll share hands that I misplayed badly during the week.

#### Hand 1
Hand 1 is online:

I think that it's a fold on the river for the following reasons:
When he cold-call the 3-bet preflop, his range is 77-QQ a lot, and maybe some strong suited Ax like ATs AQs. On the river, JJ isn't betting on a Q high board, and I block AQs that bet the turn. In my head, I knew it's going to be TT more than 66% of the time, and I flicked in the call "just to see it"(!!). Kind of autopilot. I think it's a bad call.

#### Hand 2
Live 2/5, effective 750$
I open to $15 from UTG, someone who 3-bet a lot from BU 3-bets to $45, bb calls, I 4-bet AQo as a bluff to $145 they both call. I hate life at that point. QJ3 rainbow flop, BB checks, I checked with this hand, fearing the JJ(wtf it's only 3 combos), BU checked. Turn 4, BB goes $145, I call BU folds, two spades. River Ts he goes $375 into the pot that I didn't calculate its size, and i folded. A few mistakes:

1. I can c-bet with value, especially when their range contains only a few better hands than mine
2. I should not fold river anyways, or at least develop a method to think clearly about those spots, and if I fold, it's not because I autopilot-ed or feared irrationally like in this spot, but because I made a calculated decision.

On the bright side, it's good that I started to develop 4-bet bluffs. Even when I get called, I need to consider the facts that I have equity postflop, estimate the situation, and think calmly. Top-top is for sure a great hand for a 4-bet pot with this SPR.
