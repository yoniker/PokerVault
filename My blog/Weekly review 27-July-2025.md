## Weekly Review - 27-July-2025

Targets I set for this week: Minimum/Target/Outstanding: 5/7/10
Actual performance: 6 hours (between minimum and target).


### The monsters I want to compete with - how hard did they work?
However, I feel like I not only can do more, but I should do more. So many strong players talked about a period of time in which they worked like crazy. Here are few concrete examples:

I already mentioned Yolen(studied for 2 years, started with 8 hours a day),

Josef "Sunni_92" Schusteritsch https://youtu.be/YqZQzsH52vQ?t=5087
: The peak progress time, my day looked like, was a lot of poker for me, I was playing a session in the morning, my main playing time was morning until the afternoon, then i had a break (gym,food, free time), then study partner having a routine of playing the GTO trainer looking at reports or getting through spot by spot to understand how spots are being playing, 6 days a week, average of 3-4 hours of studying, and then in the evening another session of 2-3 hours, so at peak time (of progress) I'd spent at least 70 hours per week of poker related stuff

Mateo "schyllae" Urretavizcaya: https://youtu.be/GszT_WxJoEk?t=3807 : "I was working hard...everyone has a ceiling but the height of that ceiling depends on how hard you work...I regretted not working as hard as I could on my basketball so I promised myself when I'll get the next change I'll work as hard as I can" https://youtu.be/GszT_WxJoEk?t=1379 "I was doing so much poker, i had so much love for the game i didn't really care..I would play so often so much, I would do like 12 hours a day of poker, I maybe played 6-8 hours and the rest i would be studying or watching videos..."


,Rui Cao https://youtu.be/SBXBz0Z67CI?t=698 "100% poker,from the time I wake up until I sleep was poker, fully poker, I just wake up, play poker, eat with friends talk to them poker, afternoon poker, I was entire poker for a few years"

Builderman, https://youtu.be/sQZFlA9F1gI?t=8790, "if you really believe that you can do anything, I'm not smarter than any other player, I just worked pretty hard and i set goals, long terms goals and I achieved them, so can you, so can anyone, don't be afraid to do things, and really really pursue it"

Since I want to look back (even if I fail to become a strong poker player) with no regrets, I'll set an implicit, non-quantifiable goal of giving my studies my absolute best (while keeping my good habit of studying poker for one hour as soon as I get up in the morning). So, while I'll keep the same goal target, I'll keep in mind my own long-term goal, and how hard the monsters that got there,and I want to eventually compete with, worked. 

### A slight tweak to my system

While I want to use actual play as a way to close the deliberate practice of my studies, I noticed that the previous bucketing of flop textures gave me very few hands per hour, so I've changed the bucketing into 5 bigger textures:
Monotone/Paired/Connected/High Disconnected/Low Disconnected

I even wrote a computer program to estimate the frequency of their appearance in "nature" (on the actual board)- (this is only a good estimation as this doesn't take into account the hole card ranges of the players which block/unblock textures):

#### Natural Flop Type Frequencies (Out of 22,100 Flops)

| Flop Type         | Count  | Frequency | Percentage |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Monotone          | 1,144  | 0.0518    | 5.18%      |
| Paired            | 3,796  | 0.1718    | 17.18%     |
| High Disconnected | 10,320 | 0.4674    | 46.74%     |
| Low Disconnected  | 3,000  | 0.1357    | 13.57%     |
| Connected         | 3,840  | 0.1738    | 17.38%     |
The idea is to study based on those frequencies (and play focusing on one family also in a 'weighted' way if it makes sense, eg high disconnected focus should be about 3 times as much as focusing on connected boards).

The most ideal thing would be to multiply those frequencies at the EV of studying each board, but as long as I don't have MDA this is the best I can do(and is most likely a very good approximation of the ideal path-if such a thing exists...).
### This week's goals
Minimum/Target/Outstanding: 5/7/10

Have a great&productive week everyone!
