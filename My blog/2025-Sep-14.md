After watching some play and explains I’m trying to be more aggressive with reason. Here are two hands where I went off the rails:

In this hand, I 4-bet since the stats of sb were 14% 3-bet 50%ATS 

I think that people who 3-bet as much as GTO or more, will fold a ton late vs late, as they should have continued like suited connectors and 5-bet jams bluffs like suited aces that they won’t find.
This let to this punt-in-theory preflop, with a hand that has minimal playability.

 Rest of the hand is straightforward.

In this hand, I shoved river since on the flop he tanked, and I don’t think that a flush draw tanks on the flop very often. So even though my value range on the river is super narrow (KK probably can only bluff catch there), I thought he would fold most of his range.
