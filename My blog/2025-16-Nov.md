Study poker targets were: Minimum 7 hours Target 10 hours Outrageous - 14 hours Actual: 14.5 hours (outrageous)

Outrageous indeed- but to be fair, I worked hard on my preflop and played MUCH LESS. I explored how population reacts and what I should do about that. It's funny how complicated it is. For example, people tend to open tighter and underfold to 3-bets in many spots (say, they open UTG and face a 3-bet from CO), which means that in theory, if there is no extra EV postflop compared to GTO, I want to 3-bet more linear and tighter, but postflop playing a 3-bet pot in position a lot is great (eg more value in EV in human vs human compared to GTO vs GTO), which means that I want to bet wider(!!). 

I've made myself a booklet of 66 pages covering all non mw spots, and made 72 flashcards from just the conclusions and the data that those conclusions relied upon.

For the upcoming week I want to play much more and study only 1 hour a day. Also, I'm starting to be afraid of giving myself excuses not to play, I'm so perfectionist that I'll never feel "ready". Therefore I will put myself two kind of targets: Study target, play target.

Study targets: Minimum 4 hours Target 5 hours Outrageous 8 hours
Play targets: minimum: 20 hours, Target 25 hours(yeah!), outrageous: 40 hours

Bankroll wise, I lost a little (over one BI), and got another $150 ticket (I have 5 tickets now lol) in the weekly freeroll:

It's nice to finish 60 out of 29k players (and that's only because of a cooler eg last hand I had AJo sb vs bb, 4BB deep + 1BB ante), even if it's a freeroll where the level isn't wsop main event final table ![😄](https://discord.com/assets/58a76b2430663605.svg)

Have a great week everyone!
