Those were my weekly goals:
Study targets: Minimum 4 hours Target 5 hours Outrageous 8 hours
Play targets: minimum: 20 hours, Target 25 hours(yeah!), outrageous: 40 hours

Actual: Study - 5 hours(target), play:12 hours(below minimum)

I'm not going to sugar-coat it, this is the first time I've failed to reach my minimum. This is not a coincidence. When I study I feel "safe". When I play... I feel this stress from not knowing what's going to happen. I'm not even on a downswing (my BR went up thx to gg's promotions ), and i honestly don't mind losing a stack of $10. 

So, for the professional players reading this, if you can do me a favor and tell me, do you feel this tension/stress too when playing? How do you make the experience more enjoyable/manageable? Also, any other advice will be great. 
This is a serious issue: with all the technical skills in the world, if I won't show up, my chance of success is exactly 0%.

This weekend I'll visit a friend so:

Study targets: Minimum 4 hours Target 5 hours Outrageous 8 hours
Play targets: minimum: 10 hours, Target 12 hours, outrageous: 20 hours
