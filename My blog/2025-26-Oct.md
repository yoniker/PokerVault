Study poker targets were: Minimum 7 hours  Target 10 hours  Outrageous - 14 hours
Actual: 8.5 hours

I've played more than I've studied, Bankroll went up a bit to 1890$ (plus 400$ in tournament tickets, Ggpoker has so many promotions right now, I can see why they are the most popular platform, they invest in their UI and UX a ton).
I really am considering paying for GTO's Elite subscription. It's super expensive, but this way I'll get direct answers to questions, like, what if I know that villian bets range on this board, what if I bet range and get called etc etc. Maybe I should try deepsolver first-it looks the same but for a fraction of the price... I should def ask around what people think about it.
Regardless,I'm happy that I have the habit of studying as soon as I wake up.
It feels so much better and automatic. 
Also, it's silly but I realize now that play is not instead of studying, It is an essential part of studying. Implement new idea, and also understand my weaknesses in real game, as well as spots I'm totally not sure about.
