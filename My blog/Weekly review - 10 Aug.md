## Mental breakdown

There's no good way to say that: I've had a total mental breakdown, and I've lost 7 buy ins for no good reason. The way it manifested, I've had a bad day, and so I found myself falling into a bad habit of playing poker for 'fun', mindlessly clicking buttons, while running bad also made me even more tilted. Definitely not what I decided to do (play A-game only).

Therefore, I've read a book a friend recommended me ("The joy of poker") cover to cover, didn't count that as study time. He offers to use mindfulness, and I love his suggestions. I'll try to implement it when I play, and before I start playing. I hope that when I recognize I'm on tilt, I'll have the discipline not to play the game.

## Weekly goals
On top of reading the entire book, I've studied for 5 hours  (exactly the minimum)
M/T/O for next week: 5,7,10.

## Hall of shame
Here are the hands where I lost a stack or more:

Hand 1: I lost with QQ vs AJo (splashpot) running it twice

Hand 4: BVB 3-bet pot With KK with Kc as BB, after I checked flop and called turn, giving him all the rope in the world to bluff,

I'm not sure if I should fold honestly? It is a 2.5x pot jam, but could he also have just a naked Ac or just a random holding?

Hand 7: I don't remember his preflop stats, i think that CO needs to continue pure vs BU unless he's a pure nit,

OTT I don't know if I should fold though, does he have enough AK/AJ/KT betting like that?
