## Flop

On the flop, BB infrequently X/R flushes, it X/R gutshots even more (sometimes).

## Turn


When flop goes X/X  BB leads sometimes/ frequently a flush draw with its double broadway region

After flop goes X/B30/C, and the turn is a spade, BB never leads (100% check)

## River

After flop went X/B30/C, Turn As X/X, on the river BB always leads his small flushes for value. It can trap sometimes with the nuts or second nuts (K/Q high flushes), it checks smaller flushes only when it has an Ace - eg blocking a hand (top pair) which the BU will check back.
