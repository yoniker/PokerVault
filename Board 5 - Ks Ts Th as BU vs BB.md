## Flop

On the flop ATC can bet, about 65% global frequency.

## Turn

Flop goes X/X. On a Jh turn BB leads for 33%. I call everything but #small-pairs and low #A-x - those hands I call more if there's no spade in my hand, secondary effect is the h (I guess I want BB to have spades/hearts for the flush draw)

After flop goes X/B30/C on a blank turn, AT bets pure.

After flop goes X/X, on a Jd with Q3cc I frequently raise(Qx of spades just call-too strong of a draw to bet i guess), and when i do, on a blank river I always overbet.

## River

After the flop goes X/B30/R34/C, turn goes X/X, and on the river BB overbets B125,
on a 4d3s runout, BU just calls with most of his flushes (including nut flushes), and raises only full houses and some bluffs (A4hh,K4,J4ss turn itself into a bluff sometime(!))
