The most emrassing hand from GGmaster 150$. I didn't even think for a second of going all in with a set when only a few combos are ahead of my hand. Autopilot+scared poker

Another hand in which i autopiloted, when BB the fish insta-check the turn, it's very clear my hand is ahead, and he most likely has showdown value, and I need to bet river for value.
