I open to $15 from UTG, someone who 3-bet a lot from BU 3-bets to $45, bb calls, I 4-bet AQo as a bluff to $145 they both call. I hate life at that point. QJ3 rainbow flop, BB checks, I checked with this hand, fearing the JJ, BU checked. Turn 4, BB goes $145, I call BU folds, two spades. River Ts he goes $375 into the pot that I didn't calculate its size, and i folded. A few mistakes:

1. I can c-bet with value, especially when their range contains only a few better hands than mine
2. I should not fold river anyways, or at least develop a method to think clearly about those spots.
On the bright side, it's good that I start to develop 4-bet bluffs. Even when I get called, I need to consider the facts that I have equity postflop, estimate the situation, and think calmly.


Another hand that bothers me: I had QTs, flop was ATK, checked around, turn blank fish bet $15, in my hand i was like, I will call now and can bluff river, river blank, he bet $25, I raised to $75. I think that I had two mistakes right there:
1. My story didn't make a lot of sense maybe. If I had KQ/TT I would have raised turn mostly
2. If I want the fish to fold an A, I have to go larger. He called my $75 raise with A4o, snapped.

I played tired today, and couldn't think clearly. I need to develop a systematic way of thinking that I believe in, so that I will always play as some basic good level.

I want to always ask "What do I think is the baseline play" eg GTO, then think how I want to deviate. Also when they bet I want to think about how much fold equity I have vs different bet sizes vs their likely range.

I have QQ from CO, I bet 15, get raised by a tight fish BB  to 80$, I call.
Flop comes KQ2, he bet 5$. Why did I only flat? nutsophobia.
Turn blank he checks, why did I bet 5$? Because it was "funny", sheer money-torching stupidity.
I should know he has AKo, especially after I asked preflop if we can hit the bbj and he said no.

Another hand, I have KhJh and I opened and got 3-bet to $45, I decided to 4-bet him since he 3-bets enough. He tanked and looked genuinely uncomfortable and called.
Flop came QTx, 320$ in the pot. I checked almost instantly, as I was worried about QQ/TT. However, I don't think that QQ will feel this uncomfortable preflop, so I'm losing only to TT maybe, his hand looks a lot like JJ/AQ/TT/99 type oh hand, and while he could connect with this board, I think that he would almost always fold to a shove, maybe even AQ, and if i'm behind then I have OESD.
