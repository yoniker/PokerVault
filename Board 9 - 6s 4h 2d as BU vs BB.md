## Flop

after BB checks ,Global frequency betting frequency about 55%. Almost any two cards can bet, the lowest frequency are #double-broadway and the highest frequency (clost to pure) are #top-top, hand like 5x with some overcard bet frequently,unless they don't have a backdoor flush to go with it.
Overpairs betting frequency decreases with the rank of the card, eg 77 bets the most frequently and AA the least, AK close to pure bets flop(!).

When BB bets small, all of BU's range continues except its worst broadway cards.

## Turn

After flop goes B30-C and then overbet a 3s turn, BU continues with his 5x of course, but also flush draws, all pocket pairs no exception, and with any pair pure, unless the kicker is an Ace and then it only continues sometimes 

After action goes B30-C X turn, BU's nut flushes with lower kickers tend to bet way more (sometimes pure) than their bigger kickers counterparts (A9+)

## River

After flop goes X/B30/C, turn goes X/X and on the river BB checks, on a 3,Ace runout BU bets frequently with AJ+ (AQ pure bets) on the 4-to-a-straight board
