After watching some play and explains I’m trying to be more aggressive with reason. Here are two hands where I went off the rails:

In this hand, I 4-bet since the stats of sb were 14 3-bet 50ATS. Rest of the hand is straightforward.

In this hand, I shoved river since on the flop he tanked, and I don’t think that a flush draw tanks on the flop. So even though my value range is super narrow (top set probably can only bluff catch there), I thought he would fold most of his range.
