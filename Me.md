## Part 1 — Vision, Goals & Success Metrics  
*Written for someone who knows absolutely nothing about you or your process.*

### 1.1 Who you are & why you play  
- **Identity in one line:** a technically minded 2\$/5\$ poker live player and online Rush&Cash NL10 (ggpoker) cash-game player (online is used FOR NOW for learning purposes only) who approaches improvement like an engineering project—heavy on solvers, data, and tight feedback loops.  
- **Core aspiration:** Become the best poker player I can be, transform poker into a dependable mid-four-figure monthly income source  
- **Guiding philosophy:** *knowledge first, money second*. Real dollars show up when concepts are truly mastered and applied with discipline.

---

### 1.2 Short-term focus (next 3–6 months)  
- **Unbreakable weekly routine** – complete the full deliberate practice loop of *theory → drill → online lab → review* loop every single week without exception.  
- **First full pass on the 25-board subset** – drill all 25 canonical flops from both perspectives (Button **and** Big Blind).  
- **Positive expected value at current stake** – keep EV BB/100 above zero at NL10 over a 15 k-hand sample; any dip below triggers an immediate diagnostic drill.  
- **Build bankroll head-room** – grow live + online roll to the next “Staircase” rung so a move-up shot is possible without sweating variance.

---

### 1.3 Long-term outlook (1–2 years)  
- **Climb the online ladder** – progress methodically toward beating Rush & Cash NL100, never skipping a rung and never ignoring EV or bankroll signals.  
- **Crush $2/$5 live** – average roughly \$3 000 profit per month with modest (≤ 50 h) volume at Playground Poker Club.  
- **Keep the engine running** – end every single week with a complete export, analysis, and plan-for-next-week cycle; no “dark weeks” allowed.

---

### 1.4 Your scoreboard — how success is measured  
- **EV BB/100** – solver-aligned expected value per 100 hands, tracked separately for online and tagged live spots.  
- **Solver-match percentage** – share of actions that mirror GTOWizard at a given board and node; ≥ 80 % before a board is declared “mastered.”  
- **Tilt rating (0–5)** – self-logged mental state after each session; average should stay at 2 or below, with any 4-5 spike prompting mental-game review.  
- **Bankroll vs. Staircase targets** – actual money plus “virtual cash-out” ledger must clear the next rung before any stake jump; dipping below the buffer means an automatic move-down.  
- **Board-family coverage** – study time across the six flop families should stay within about ± 5 % of real-world frequency weights.

### 1.5 Foundational principles that govern everything  
1. **Deliberate practice trumps raw volume.** Every hand needs a learning purpose; undirected grind comes only after leaks are fixed.  
2. **Feedback loops close inside 24 hours.** Insights → flashcards → online lab → solver review, all in a single day when possible.  
3. **Risk-managed climbing.** Bankroll and EV statistics *pull* you upward; ego never pushes.  
4. **Total transparency.** Every activity (sleep, study, gym, live play) is logged as a standalone entry, exported weekly, and inspected—nothing hides in the shadows.
