Last study session 7-July

## Flop

BU range bet on this board on the flop. 
on the flop vs a small x/r, BU calls with any pair, any two broadways, and many backdoors like A5hh

## Turn

Flop goes X/B30/C turn is 9d BB checks. BU bluffs a lot with his Jx and Qx that don't have SDV. Can sometimes value bet thin with QT/AT. 


## River

Flop goes X/B30/C Turn 5d x/x river 2h BB B50, BU calls with ANY pair, but also with some A-x that don't block his missed draws (so AJ/AQ almost always pure fold, A9o calls with Ac which unblocks BB's backdoor flush draws)
