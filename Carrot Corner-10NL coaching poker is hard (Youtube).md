I open UTG with AKo, board comes A57r, how can I not have this fear of BB having a set? Well, think, yes he can have a set, but there are way more combinations of a worse top pair, second pair, draws etc, and I need to target those hands which are way more common and abundant. If the opponent will play in a way that is typical of a set, for example, X/R flop and pot turn, or X/C flop, and X/R turn huge, I can just fold as people don't do it enough with worse hands than AK.
