## Part 1 — Current Study Methodology  
*A clean, stand-alone description of exactly how you study today and how that study will expand over time.*

---

### 1.1 Scope and Drill Focus  

- **Board-by-Board:** One study block = one canonical board (e.g., “Board 11 — Ts 8h 3s”), drilled (random turn/river and actions by villian determined by GTOW practice tool) for 25 minutes (a pomodoro block)
- **Current Configuration:** *Button vs Big Blind, single-raised pot, pre-flop raiser in position* (BU vs BB SRP PFR IP).  
- **Future Configurations (four total):**  
  1. **SRP — PFR IP** (current)  
  2. **SRP — PFR OOP** (e.g., BB defends vs CO open)  
  3. **3-bet pot — PFR IP** (e.g., BTN 3-bets vs LJ open)  
  4. **3-bet pot — PFR OOP** (e.g., BB 3-bets vs BTN open)  
- **Expansion Rule:** Finish all 25 boards in all 4 configurations. Only after a full pass in a category for the most frequent setup within the configuration do secondary positions enter the queue (e.g., *LJ vs BB* for SRP PFR IP).

### 1.2 Single-Board Drill Procedure  

1. Load the chosen board in GTOWizard Drill mode under the current configuration.  
2. Play solver spots from flop → random turn → random river until the timer ends.  
3. Record every mistake/surprise in an Obsidian note dedicated to that board.  
4. use AI with my new notes and create flashcards using the AI for Anki.

### 1.3 Flashcard Pipeline  
More elaborate instructions for creating flashcards from new data will be given in a different file.

 Flashcards are reviewed ad-hoc throughout the day (commute, gym, breaks).

---

### 1.4 Online Mini-Lab Template  

- **Play Block (30–40 min):** 1 Rush & Cash  table; the idea was focusing on a specific family of flops and tagging every flop from the target board family or hands-but i find that i barely get a similar board within 40 minutes so maybe this can be improved.
- **Rapid Review (20 min):** filter tags in PokerTracker 4, replay hands in GTOWizard, and add up to three new flashcards.

### 1.5 Tracking & Weekly Review  

- Each activity (sleep, study, gym, live/online play) is logged as an individual entry.  
- Every Sunday: export the week’s logs, rebuild the activity table,think of improvements/changes needed, and set the next rotation.

- **Obsidian** — one note per board.  
- **Anki** — spaced-repetition deck fed by the flashcard pipeline.
