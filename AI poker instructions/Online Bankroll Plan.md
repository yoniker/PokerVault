## Bankroll Plan — “The Staircase”  
*A stand-alone explanation of how my online poker bankroll is managed and why the rules look the way they do.*

---

### 1 Core Principles  
 
1. **No ego shots.**  
   I only move up in stakes when _both_ the bankroll threshold _and_ recent win-rate targets are met.  
2. **Automatic move-downs.**  
   If either cushion disappears, I step back instantly—no “one-more-session” exceptions.  
3. **Virtual cash-outs.**  
   A running ledger of “pretend withdrawals” locks in profit on paper, forcing the real bankroll to rebuild before each new shot.

### 2 Online Cash “Staircase”  

| Rung                  | Bankroll required | Virtual cash-out ledger | Total that must be built before the shot |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Play NL10 → Shot NL25 | \$ 750            | \$ 625                  | \$ 1 375                                 |
| NL25 → NL50           | \$ 1 500          | \$ 1 250                | \$ 2 750                                 |
| NL50 → NL100          | \$ 3 000          | \$ 2 500                | \$ 5 500                                 |

**Move-up conditions**  
- The real bankroll _and_ the virtual ledger are both filled.  
- EV BB/100 over the last 15 000 hands is positive ( ≥ +0BB/100 for moving on to the next level)  

**Move-down triggers**  
- Bankroll falls below the safety buffer

### 4 Current Status Snapshot  

- **Online:** playing Rush & Cash NL10, building toward the \$1 375 shot bankroll (it was technically met because I have $1500 but my win rate is -2BB/100 so I can't move up yet)  

---

### 5 Next Checkpoint  

- Review bankroll and EV metrics every Sunday after the weekly log export.  
- If the online roll hits \$1 375 _and_ EV BB/100 ≥ 0, move up to RC25NL at GGpoker.
