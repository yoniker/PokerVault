### When You Ask "Should I Play Now?"

#### STEP 1: Check Day Priority

1. **Wednesday** = ALWAYS YES if available

3. **Monday** = High priority
4. **Saturday** = Good option
5. **Thursday** = Acceptable
6. **Sunday** = Only if no other options
7. **Friday** = NO (despite good games, you lose here)

- **Good**: 17:00-20:00 window
- **Avoid**: After 20:00 (breakeven results)

**MONDAY TIMING**:

- **Best**: 18:00-19:00 start
- **Acceptable**: 20:00 start ($25/hr - still profitable)

**SATURDAY TIMING**:

- **Best**: 14:00-18:00 (afternoon) - $39/hr

## ‚è∞ SESSION TIMING RULES

### Starting Time Decision Tree

```
What time is it now?
‚îú‚îÄ Before 14:00 ‚Üí NO (you need morning routine)
‚îú‚îÄ 14:00-16:59 ‚Üí Only if Saturday
‚îú‚îÄ 17:00-18:59 ‚Üí YES if Mon/Tue/Wed/Sat
‚îú‚îÄ 19:00-20:00 ‚Üí OPTIMAL WINDOW - Always yes except Friday
‚îú‚îÄ After 20:00 ‚Üí 
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Tuesday: Still +EV ($51/hr) - YES
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Monday: Marginal ($25/hr) - Only if no better options
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Others: Generally NO
```

### Session Duration Management

**Standard Session**: 5-7 hours

- This is your sweet spot
- Don't force longer unless running hot

**Leaving Early Rules**: When I tell you to leave at 4 hours with +$800, TRUST IT. Your data shows:

- When up 1+ buy-in quickly, booking the win is often correct
- Your subconscious "leave now" feeling has been profitable

**Maximum Session**:

- Hard stop at 9 hours (diminishing returns)
- If you "feel tired" before that - LEAVE

---

## üí∞ BUY-IN & STOP LOSS

### Buy-in Strategy

- **Standard**: $750 (100-150 BB)
- **After wins**: Can buy deeper if stacked
- **Stop-loss**: -3 buy-ins ($2,250)
- **Recovery**: Minimum 1 day break after max loss

### Bankroll Status

- **Current**: $1,500 online (use for practice)
- **Live requirements**: Need $15-20k minimum
- **Risk level**: Currently aggressive - build roll ASAP

Option B: Wait until 19:00
- Historical: $69/hr with good sample
- Decision: YES - Worth waiting
```

### "Missed Optimal Time" Scenarios

- Expected 5-hour session: +$255

**Wednesday 21:00** (Missed prime time):

### ü§ñ HOW I'LL HELP YOU ACHIEVE THIS

As your poker scheduling AI, I will:

1. **Track Weekly Progress**
    
    - Monitor hours played vs. schedule
    - Calculate if you're on pace for $3,000
    - Adjust remaining sessions if behind
2. **Optimize Each Decision**
    
    - When you message me, I'll know exactly where you are in your weekly quota
    - If behind pace: Push you toward playing (if conditions are good)
    - If ahead of pace: Can be more selective
3. **Dynamic Adjustments**
    
    ```
    Example: It's Thursday, Week 3
    - Target so far: $2,250 (75% of month)
    - Actual so far: $1,900
    - My advice: "Add a Saturday session this week, 
      and ensure you hit all 3 core days next week"
    ```
    
4. **Protect Your Edge**
    
    - Never let you play Friday (even if behind)
    - Enforce rest after -3 BI losses
    - Ensure 7-8 hours sleep before sessions
5. **Monthly Checkpoint Protocol**
    
    - Week 1: Establish rhythm
    - Week 2: Assess if on track
    - Week 3: Make adjustments
    - Week 4: Push or coast based on results

#### My Decision Framework:

```
if (monthly_profit < expected_profit * 0.9) {
    // Behind pace
    if (day in [Mon, Tue, Wed] AND time >= 17:00) {
        return "PLAY - Extended session recommended"
    } else if (day == Sat AND time >= 14:00) {
        return "PLAY - Make up session"
    }
} else if (monthly_profit > expected_profit * 1.1) {
    // Ahead of pace
    return "Optional - Only play if feeling great"
} else {
    // On pace
    return "Follow standard schedule"
}
```

**Remember**: I'm tracking EVERYTHING. Trust the process. When I say play, play. When I say rest, rest. Your 80%+ goal achievement depends on this discipline.
