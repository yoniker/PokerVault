## 🎯 REAL-TIME DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When You Ask "Should I Play Now?"

#### STEP 1: Check Day Priority

1. **Wednesday** = ALWAYS YES if available
2. **Tuesday** = High priority
3. **Monday** = High priority
4. **Saturday** = Good option
5. **Thursday** = Acceptable
6. **Sunday** = Only if no other options
7. **Friday** = NO (despite good games, you lose here)

#### STEP 2: Check Optimal Time Windows

**TUESDAY SPECIFIC TIMING** (since you asked):

- **Best**: 19:00 start ($69/hr)
- **Great**: 20:00 start ($59/hr)
- **Good**: 18:00 start ($41/hr)
- **Acceptable**: 17:00 start ($45/hr)
- **Skip**: Earlier than 17:00

**WEDNESDAY TIMING**:

- **Best**: 18:00-19:00 start
- **Good**: 17:00-20:00 window
- **Avoid**: After 20:00 (breakeven results)

**MONDAY TIMING**:

- **Best**: 18:00-19:00 start
- **Acceptable**: 20:00 start ($25/hr - still profitable)

**SATURDAY TIMING**:

- **Best**: 14:00-18:00 (afternoon) - $39/hr
- **Good**: 18:00+ (evening) - $43/hr
- **Avoid**: Morning sessions

#### STEP 3: Pre-Flight Checklist

✅ **GREEN LIGHT if ALL true**:

- Slept 7-8 hours
- Not within 24 hours of 3-BI loss
- Feel "good" (not "bad")
- It's not Friday
- It's past 14:00 (you don't do mornings)

❌ **RED LIGHT if ANY true**:

- Less than 7 hours sleep
- Lost 3 buy-ins yesterday
- Feel "bad" or tilted
- It's Friday
- Typical wake time (11-12) + less than 2 hours

## ⏰ SESSION TIMING RULES

### Starting Time Decision Tree

```
What time is it now?
├─ Before 14:00 → NO (you need morning routine)
├─ 14:00-16:59 → Only if Saturday
├─ 17:00-18:59 → YES if Mon/Tue/Wed/Sat
├─ 19:00-20:00 → OPTIMAL WINDOW - Always yes except Friday
├─ After 20:00 → 
│  ├─ Tuesday: Still +EV ($51/hr) - YES
│  ├─ Monday: Marginal ($25/hr) - Only if no better options
│  └─ Others: Generally NO
```

### Session Duration Management

**Standard Session**: 5-7 hours

- This is your sweet spot
- Don't force longer unless running hot

**Leaving Early Rules**: When I tell you to leave at 4 hours with +$800, TRUST IT. Your data shows:

- When up 1+ buy-in quickly, booking the win is often correct
- Your subconscious "leave now" feeling has been profitable

**Maximum Session**:

- Hard stop at 9 hours (diminishing returns)
- If you "feel tired" before that - LEAVE

---

## 💰 BUY-IN & STOP LOSS

### Buy-in Strategy

- **Standard**: $750 (100-150 BB)
- **After wins**: Can buy deeper if stacked
- **Stop-loss**: -3 buy-ins ($2,250)
- **Recovery**: Minimum 1 day break after max loss

### Bankroll Status

- **Current**: $1,500 online (use for practice)
- **Live requirements**: Need $15-20k minimum
- **Risk level**: Currently aggressive - build roll ASAP

---

## 📊 EXPECTED VALUE BY SCENARIO

### Tuesday at 14:00 Example

```
Option A: Play now (14:00 start)
- Historical: Limited data, high variance
- Decision: NO - Wait for 17:00+

Option B: Wait until 19:00
- Historical: $69/hr with good sample
- Decision: YES - Worth waiting
```

### "Missed Optimal Time" Scenarios

**Tuesday 21:00** (Missed prime time):

- Still play? YES - $51/hr on late starts
- Expected 5-hour session: +$255

**Wednesday 21:00** (Missed prime time):

- Still play? NO - Breakeven after 20:00
- Do something else

**Saturday Morning** (Early opportunity):

- Still play? NO - Negative results
- Wait for 14:00+

## 🧠 MENTAL GAME INTEGRATION

- **Your pattern**: You need 1 day to reset
- **Friday curse**: Even when games are good, you lose - respect this

### Energy Management

- **Sleep requirement**: 7-8 hours minimum
- **Typical schedule**: Sleep 3-4 AM, wake 11-12
- **Optimal play window**: 17:00-02:00 (aligns with your rhythm)

### Trust the Process

You asked me to be thorough because you'll trust my decisions:

- When I say leave - LEAVE
- When I say don't play - DON'T PLAY
- Your Friday results prove discipline > game quality

## 📈 MONTHLY SESSION PLANNING

### Optimal Week Structure

- **Thursday**: Skip or short session
