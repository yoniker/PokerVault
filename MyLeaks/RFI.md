# 📈 RFI (Raise First In) Study Log

## 🔷 Why I’m Working On This

- Leak: Under-opening in all positions due to comfort zone, despite knowing theoretical ranges.
- Goal: Execute correct RFI ranges by position until they feel automatic.
- Plan: Use GTOWizard drills + focused play sessions + tracking PFR stats to close the gap.
