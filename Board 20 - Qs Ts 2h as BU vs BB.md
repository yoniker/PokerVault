Global bet frequency is 50%, 
hands that pure check - A8/A7 no spade no hearts (only Aheart bets), ATC can bet, only hands that bet pure are sets, small pps with a spade bet infrequently

## River

Flop goes X/X, turn Qd X/B75/C, on the river I bluff only Jx or Kx for a big sizing B125 (and Qx goes for value)
