## Flop

## Turn

Flop goes X/B50/C
Turn 3d X/B81-
77 with 7s is almost always folding, flush draws are folding a lot too(!) (except those with a pair/nut flush draws), the only pure continues are Jx,3x, nut flush draws, or flushes+a pair. Solver also like A5o with some spade

Flop goes X/X turn Td X/B115, BB pure continues with any JX of course but also Tx except T9 since the 9 is a bad card to have (blocking some draws) which continues pure with a spade,  and infrequently without a spade. In the rare instances that BB raises vs this overbet, it's always with some equity (OESD plus)

## River

flop goes X/B30/C Turn 8c X/X river 7d X/B50 BB with A9ss frequently call infrequently folds never raises, BB likes bluffing 75/67 sometimes,97/T7 infrequently and for value sets(pure), AJ(sometimes), pure calling are all the Ax with a pair on the board like A3/A8/A7/A4

Flop goes X/X Turn 3c X/X river if it's a blank like 2d then QJ BB leads pure, if it's connected to the board like 2s then it sometimes leads sometimes checks
