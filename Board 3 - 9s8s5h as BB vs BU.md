## Flop

I check the flop, BU B50, I x/r(=check/raise):
sets (88/55/99) sometimes ,65ss can infrequently X/R,straights pure x/r,two pair NEVER x/r,
JTo/QTo with a spade sometimes,A5o with As, all the 7x region can infrequently X/R(with a spade it's more frequent but that's a combo draw).

## Turn 

99 no spade flop went X/X, on A turn, I can overbet frequently,

if the turn is 6s,BB can lead with QJhh/QTcc (gutshot), some flushes, 7x with a kicker that didn't connect with the board (if BU connected with the board with a pair he's more likely to check back),and rarely some trash like K3hh

## River

flop went X/B50/C turn X/X on a Jd6s runout, the 7x that BB leads with pure are ones with a kicker that didn't connect with the board. For example, J7/97 is pure checking because BU will check less (he might check back with a J/9 because of enough SDV).
