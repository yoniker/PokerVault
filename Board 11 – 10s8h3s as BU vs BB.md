## Flop

## Turn

## River

On river cards that complete straights or other strong draws, GTO checks back top pair and even overpairs at a very high frequency (sometimes pure), rather than betting thin for value.
    - This surprised meâ€”I expected to value bet top pair/overpair more often. GTO prefers to avoid betting into a polarized range on connected runouts.
