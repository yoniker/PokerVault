1. I'm on the sb with Js2s, 19/7 2k hands player sitting in BB - I should open(this is a bit wider than GTO), as he will under-defend. Same for K7o when there are players with 19 and 17 vpip in the sb and bb
2.  AJo sometimes 3-bet as BU vs LJ open, but when the opener is tight like 20/17 I want to not do it.
3. Be patient, and take my time when taking decisions
4. In this player pool, people play their hand - if they raise they have a good hand - just fold
