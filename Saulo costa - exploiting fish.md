Date of study: 30-June-2025

1. I should overbluff very frequently (even with sdv) vs fish (TT on AKXXX board)
2. Play a much much wider range (Saulo showed hands where high stakes pros showed with 63o, 85o and A2o vs fish)
3. Call down way way wider vs fish - they overbluff and come up with bluffs that have nothing to do with the board (exception is passive tight fish)
