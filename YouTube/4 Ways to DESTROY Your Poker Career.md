## 1. Checking results too often -


this conditions my brain to think that it matters whether I'm up or down.
It's natural for us, as resource-tracking specie to track resources, but it's wrong. 
Do I remember what happened on 19-Nov-2023? Nope. Would I care now? nope. what if I was down 7 buy ins? still no. What I care about are my annual results, If I can beat the game long-term,  if I'm becoming a better poker player, etc.

It becomes a habit, a source of dopamine.

Solution: When I catch myself doing it (in an unstructured way) intervene and tell myself "I literally won't care in 5 days".


## 2. Drinking Alchohol 

Completely irrelevant to me so I fast-forwarded that

## 3.Ego

Making bad calls and paying a premium in underbluffed spots for mental issues and stupid thoughts like "I don't want to get bullied/run over". 

Solution: Remember that it's ok to be bluffed and be bullied out of a hand: it's part of the game. Advanced players can even have a sense of satisfaction making money-making folds in under-bluffed spots "The fold of a lion".

## 4. Practical games

Playing too long - playing LONG sessions, getting satisfaction in playing the game rather than keeping a clear mind which can make optimal decisions.  This is like a gaming addict/ gambler and not a  professional poker mindset.

Playing on family time/playing for leisure - always play on full focus mode (as if I'm studying for an exam or I'm on a job interview)

Solution: Have a healthy time limit for playing
