He studied GTO for 2.5 years without playing, thought he will develop an edge by just having a theoretical knowledge, and yet lost money as soon as he started playing NL50, "Poker is the only discipline where you can put a lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work", went down to 10NL and was winning there...
Was contacted by Leo, he staked him and told him that the most important thing is thinking about the ev of your exact hand.

If he could back in time he would take a coach which will direct him - he studied 4-bet pots before he studied any bvb for example :D So anyways other than a coach:
-Study spots that happen frequently
-Understand theoretical concepts
-Learn how to exploit
-Play-to solidify what was studied

Pay close attention to EV mistakes and less attention to mixing mistakes.
## What to look for in a coach
Coaching is human interaction, so if the person is boring/I don't like him-don't choose him (retention of information will be better with someone interesting).

## How to get the most out of coaching/studying
Ask "what are the 3 most important things I've learned (it's also true to watching a video)", this way I'll remember the info from that video much later vs forget all about it after some time. That's why it's important to take notes on things I don't know and are important.

The best thing to do is summarize the info and then use a spaced-repitition app like Anki. 

## Studying-performance gap in poker
Why is studying the theory doesn't make you instantly a better poker player?
Because poker is like a language: If I only study it in theory and try to speak it I will not do well,too many areas which need to be practiced in a game to perform better, if I only study I will have a lot of information in my head, but I wouldn't know what to choose in real time.

## How did it feel when he was breaking-even after studying so much

He felt sadness, he felt pain, he wasn't confident, and he had this philosophy of trying his best, and if it doesn't work then he will move to something else (when he couldn't beat microstakes after years of studying poker). During downswings I'm going to feel pain, resilience is a very important thing to have. It's normal that poker takes a lot of time. Poker is a very large area and sometimes it doesn't work in the beginning.

## Important advice: Taking my time
Even in a 4BB pot when villian bets 1BB, take your time, even 30 seconds, to think about it. Build the neural connections so that later on I can do it faster than other people. Some people act instantly, and the big big big problems about acting instantly:
1. I don't take the right decisions
2. In the long run my results will suffer - I didn't build the thought process that good results require

## Advice on translating GTO to the human world
I want to 
Let's say that I'm in a bluff catching situation. My opponent played in a certain way, let's say he 3-bet then 3-barrelled. The question I can ask are:
1. Does his play value in this way sometimes? If yes, then my EV cannot be all of the pot.
2. What will people do on average? Let's say there are 10 players, how many will only have bluffs on this spot? how many balanced? how many only value?
3. Off the felt, I need to think about situations where even 9/10 of the players slightly overbluff but one player will never bluff, then my EV might actually be negative overall. Do those kind of calculations every once in a while to have some idea about how to play vs humans. I need to think about the specific player's range distribution as well when deciding.

## About fixing mistakes
Be thankful for being able to learn from my mistakes - in some areas of life I can't learn from my mistakes. Accept that poker is like a language-and I might "knowingly" (after-the-fact) make the same mistake again and again, even 100 times, until I don't, it takes time, it's normal, accept this, embrace it.

## The problem about using MDA
Many guys who use MDA follow sheets, what on average is the best action here, which doesn't allow them to focus on what the villian is actually doing and develop deeper level thinking - can't develop an effective thinking process while following sheets.

## How to make good decisions during a hand
Here are things to think about during a hand:
1. What's the profile of the player I'm playing against?
2. What's his perception of me?
3. If I had to bet everything on what's the best action, what it would be?
Remember that poker isn't about making good moves, but making less mistakes.

The toughest stakes for Yolen were 50NL because on 25NL there are no pros and 100NL there are pros, so 50NL is the cutting point.

## The one thing that predicts which student will succeed
Is how deeply they think about a hand. What prevents people from thinking deeply the most is...being lazy :) (Yolen). Thinking deeply takes energy. Curiosity is like free energy.

## Worst advice in poker
are the two words "You need". You need to call, you need to do this and that.
If I have the second nuts and I think that the best action is to fold, I can fold.
Or "I can't" eg "I can't fold this" "I can't raise this".

## Most important lesson Yolen learnt from poker
Enjoy what you do, enjoy the process, don't put too much pressure on myself
