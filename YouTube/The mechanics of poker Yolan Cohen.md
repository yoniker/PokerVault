He studied GTO for 2.5 years without playing, thought he will develop an edge by just having a theoretical knowledge, and yet lost money as soon as he started playing NL50, "Poker is the only discipline where you can put a lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work", went down to 10NL and was winning there...
Was contacted by Leo, he staked him and told him that the most important thing is thinking about the ev of your exact hand.

If he could back in time he would take a coach which will direct him - he studied 4-bet pots before he studied any bvb for example :D So anyways other than a coach:
-Study spots that happen frequently
-Understand theoretical concepts
-Learn how to exploit
-Play-to solidify what was studied

Pay close attention to EV mistakes and less attention to mixing mistakes.
## What to look for in a coach
Coaching is human interaction, so if the person is boring/I don't like him-don't choose him (retention of information will be better with someone interesting).

## How to get the most out of coaching/studying
Ask "what are the 3 most important things I've learned (it's also true to watching a video)", this way I'll remember the info from that video much later vs forget all about it after some time. That's why it's important to take notes on things I don't know and are important.

The best thing to do is summarize the info and then use a spaced-repitition app like Anki. 

## Studying-performance gap in poker
Why is studying the theory doesn't make you instantly a better poker player?
Because poker is like a language: If I only study it in theory and try to speak it I will not do well,too many areas which need to be practiced in a game to perform better, if I only study I will have a lot of information in my head, but I wouldn't know what to choose in real time.

## How did it feel when he was breaking-even after studying so much

He felt sadness, he felt pain, he wasn't confident, and he had this philosophy of trying his best, and if it doesn't work then he will move to something else (when he couldn't beat microstakes after years of studying poker). During downswings I'm going to feel pain, resilience is a very important thing to have. It's normal that poker takes a lot of time. Poker is a very large area and sometimes it doesn't work in the beginning.
