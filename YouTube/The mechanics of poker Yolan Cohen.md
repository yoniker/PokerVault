He studied GTO for 2.5 years without playing, thought he will develop an edge by just having a theoretical knowledge, and yet lost money as soon as he started playing NL50, "Poker is the only discipline where you can put a lot of work and sometimes it doesn't work", went down to 10NL and was winning there...
Was contacted by Leo, he staked him and told him that the most important thing is thinking about the ev of your exact hand.

If he could back in time he would take a coach which will direct him - he studied 4-bet pots before he studied any bvb for example :D So anyways other than a coach:
-Study spots that happen frequently
-Understand theoretical concepts
-Learn how to exploit
-Play-to solidify what was studied

## What to look for in a coach
Coaching is human interaction, so if the person is boring/I don't like him-don't choose him (retention of information will be better with someone interesting).

## How to get the most out of coaching
Ask "what are the 3 most important things I've learned (it's also true to watching a video)"
