Hand #1: 

Kruzer with 2h3s on BU, BB has 4% 3-bet frequency (29-4-4-4 over 160 hands) and a tight small blind (18-16-9 over 400 hands):
Kruzer: "We have a short stacker here. He's pretty tight. So, we're just going to be opening any two probably

Kruzer opened, sb 3-bets kruzer folded


Hand #2:

Kruzer opens Js2s as sb, BB calls.

Flop 7d9h5d 
Kruzer: Going to start with the range check here

X/BB snap checks
Turn Ah 
Kruzer:Going to delay my my bluff to the river, I think, when I don't have anything going with it.
Once he snap checks the flop as well like going to have like king highs, ace highs and stuff
X/X 

River Kh
 
Kruzer: now like most of his range that I expect him on the flop ace high king highs will get there but I'm still going to  use block or maybe he has like low pocket pair that he won't defend or something. So actually I'm going to use half pot. Half pot or somewhere between 40 and half pot. I think that's fine.

Kruzer bet 2.5BB into 5BB, BB folded
Kruzer: Okay, so his snap check on snap check back on the flop wasn't A high/ king high . It was just air. Good to note. I would note that if I would play these games

Hand #3:




[00:04:37] starting with a small C bet here. We don't need to go too big. The guy's short stacker holding here. No need to deviate against
[00:04:44] ETG.
[00:04:55] Okay, this guy has really big ATS. So, I would be tribetting this hand, but uh
[00:05:01] not anymore.
[00:05:08] Three betting this one.
[00:05:15] Three betting here. Really small. really small for bet, but I don't think we can continue our hand, especially against
[00:05:21] like earlier positions. It's too dominated. If I had something like pocket eights, pocket nines, jet suited,
[00:05:28] you know, hands that are always mixes in theory, I would call those hands always because of the price.
[00:05:35] Offuit hands. You generally don't want to call the only offsuit hand I would call against that size is ace queen. And
[00:05:41] even that's kind of borderline.
[00:05:47] He say, "Oh, do you want do we want to open this?" No, because we have a fish on the button. So, he's going to play
[00:05:53] a lot of uh ports in position. So, our off
[00:05:58] won't do so well against that.
[00:06:10] We see Super Tank open, but this would be too wide to three bet. Oh, we have our friend here. Value the spot.
[00:06:17] I haven't seen you in 200 in ages. I guess you went down a bit or
[00:06:22] maybe you're trying some new strategies or I don't know. Uh testing out some new stuff. I meant.
[00:06:31] Yeah. Opening there.
[00:06:47] Okay, we're going to pot this one. Good price, playable hand. 3x open from a
[00:06:52] really, really tight guy. 35 BBs. Uh, this one's pretty close. I'm going
[00:06:59] to peel. Maybe he like gives me information on the flop.
[00:07:08] I have to peel again cuz most of the fishes use half pot like one and done a lot. So maybe he gives gives up the
[00:07:14] turn. He was pretty tight. So maybe I could have lost the the I mean maybe I could
[00:07:21] have g folded the flop, but now we're here. We're just going to use small size. Start targeting his a size.
[00:07:32] 74. We could we could raise this maybe.
[00:07:40] No, it's three-way here. So, basically, we're hoping he
[00:07:46] folds the jack if we jam. Needs to be good. H 40% 90%.
[00:07:56] I don't think I'm going to give up. I think I'm going to give up this one. I meant
[00:08:02] 87.
[00:08:07] I didn't want to bluff on a spade completer. Exactly. Because he's a short stacker. I think he will over call Jack
[00:08:12] X and I already wanted I already uh folded his range that I wanted to
[00:08:18] follow on the turn. So, ace high, king queen, and stuff like that.
[00:08:26] This one will be deep. Still going to go for a bit.
[00:08:36] Pretty fast call from a 39 39 289. Okay,
[00:08:42] here we're just going to be folding against the lead
[00:08:50] from a 39 guy. Yeah, not going to do anything there.
[00:08:57] Starting with a small C bet here.
[00:09:08] Okay, checking the turn.
[00:09:16] could potentially value this like let's see seven eights jack 10 I could do some
[00:09:22] exploitative size against this guy like half pot or something make him call me wider
[00:09:29] now once he blocks is it too thin to raise king 99
[00:09:36] I don't think it's too t he's not going to be protected enough for this size I'm not saying it's
[00:09:42] impossible for him to have a strong hand but Yeah, I give him really good price to
[00:09:48] call his eights and 10. Going to be three betting this one.
[00:10:07] These sizes are really good. The second time we get a really good size. I think I'm going to peel in position this time.
[00:10:13] Cut off. Cut off versus uh button this this time as well. Before it was hijack
[00:10:19] versus cut off. So little different. Now he just checks. Probably going to start with a bet.
[00:10:29] Really weird that he didn't trade C bet this swap. Going to start with a
[00:10:36] bet on this board. Sure, why not?
[00:10:47] Yeah. So, these are the spots that you want to attack. These are the spots I wanted to
[00:10:54] that I mentioned from the start of the video. When people check a board, that's usually a range bet means they have like
[00:10:59] a queen means they have pocket jacks. Just want to attack that triple triple triple stab. You know
[00:11:07] that hand versus the recreational blind blind versus blind was different because he was short stacker. I didn't expect
[00:11:12] too much fold equity by jack region on the river. So I didn't go for my bluffs.
[00:11:18] That's why I only went for a turn bluff which I already explained but this spot is different.
[00:11:25] Okay, we see a check here. Usually people range bet these boards
[00:11:30] even though you're not supposed to. But uh so that means he either like has a ace high or some pocket pair. Just going
[00:11:36] to start with a small size. Okay. Hold it pretty fast.
[00:11:46] I don't think I ever want to check because I don't think he will reopen air on the turn.
[00:11:52] If he had air, he would most likely bet the flop unless he's playing like proper strategy.
[00:11:59] And this one we're going to be three betting. 29 25 27 decent stats.
[00:12:07] Just calling here. Uh mostly check give up this specific
[00:12:13] hand on this board. Would be betting if I had a higher over cards.
[00:12:22] Starting with a small uh I mean a probing the turn here, guys. Most likely
[00:12:29] Okay, we see a king. We see a guy checked on the start with the small exploitative size. I think if I had a
[00:12:34] king, I would go bigger here.
[00:12:40] But yeah, the the um 75 hand the guy's usually the he's probably likely to re
[00:12:46] see C bet when he snap check checks the turn. He has like king king high or something like that. That's going to be
[00:12:53] giving up. So we want to deny equity against that. super exploitable, but against possible weaker population, we
[00:13:00] could do that here. 20 206 9K hands. So against that, we don't want to be over
[00:13:07] three betting because he's naturally like you could
[00:13:13] you could think u that people would under four bet you in this takes, but if he has tight stats that means naturally
[00:13:19] he will over for bet you. I know it sounds crazy, but uh
[00:13:26] that's how it works because he's opening tighter range and if he's quar versus
[00:13:31] button, everyone's going to for bet ace king, even the biggest knit. So
[00:13:37] he's three betting, he's going to for bet. So that's ace king O plus queens. That's like 2.5% of the range. And if
[00:13:44] he's open like 25%, that's already 10% he's for betting. And now we add in some bluffs. you know, it could be 15%, it
[00:13:51] could be 20%. So, we're we're getting close to the equilibrium for bet strategy. So, against the equilibrium
[00:13:58] for bet percentage, we don't want to uh three bet wider.
[00:14:06] Sounds a bit confusing. I almost confused myself as well, but I think that's how it how it goes.
[00:14:23] Jack six 19 decent big blind don't want to expand
[00:14:30] here. We have two short stackers definitely opening wider on the cutoff in this spot.
[00:14:43] 213 going to be three betting against him
[00:14:50] squeezing now. You could expect that he will squeeze
[00:14:57] wger size versus like if you know the guys like a decent rag on the UTG. Uh
[00:15:04] this is this is pretty weird. I'm gonna call this, but like he can have queens, he can have
[00:15:10] like GTO jamming strategy is kings and his king O here, but I think I'm going to call this king suited. Yeah,
[00:15:18] you're going you're going to get u shown ace king a loting off a lot in
[00:15:24] this in this uh spot, especially how fast he he orbits.
[00:15:36] really big size. What I do against this
[00:15:41] bit I guess orbit fold
[00:15:47] it doesn't have that high three bet so but the size is really big so I don't really want to have a calling range in
[00:15:53] this spot versus this huge size. Yeah. So, I'm going to be folding orbit
[00:15:58] fold. Like I said, I think that's the best play there or fold up straight. But I don't think ace queen is is is that
[00:16:06] weak to fold up straight against NBB
[00:16:13] opening here.
[00:16:21] 1815. Yeah, we can open this.
[00:16:31] Start with a check here. That looks like a rag by his stats. So that means he's not going to be randomly over probing
[00:16:38] turn. So we get to see we get more information and we get to see we get to realize more equity.
[00:16:45] Going to be attacking this pot now with a delay and then bluffing on ace jack. Something
[00:16:52] like that. AceJ reverse. Maybe some spade reverse.
[00:17:00] Okay. No point in slow playing here unless you know the guy is like has really good
[00:17:07] ranges and that he's going to forget decent frequency. So every time when you jam the the EV of a jam is going to be
[00:17:14] way higher. Leave the guy like slightly under four bits. So you never want to slope like this.
[00:17:21] I say that and he had a forward ball, but I think it's it's the best it's the best strat overall.
[00:17:33] Maybe exactly against button. You could play close to GTO
[00:17:39] frequency with with just calls pre flop, but no, I still think it's better to to
[00:17:45] jam.
[00:17:51] especially in Russian cash because a lot of like versus button versus cut off they they have to flat queen sometimes
[00:17:56] they have to flat ace king go they have to flat um jacks you know and most
[00:18:02] people forbid those from those positions so even you're you're going to face the
[00:18:08] value even even more value part of the range even more than
[00:18:15] the
[00:18:32] check. Interesting B to check on. I think we can already start value betting
[00:18:39] with some some small size exploitatively even though this this board is is for
[00:18:46] bigger size. Nice.
[00:18:51] Um so he can have queen jack have jack nine stuff like that.
[00:19:00] Going to be using a smaller size again exploitatively. If I had Jack 10, if I had some unblocker took to took his weak
[00:19:07] king X region, I would go for a over bet. But here, I want to get called by queen X and stuff like that. Like
[00:19:12] Ajakov, I want to get called by that. Decent bluff catcher Ajako like he's
[00:19:19] ahead of the bluffs and he can he can potentially cooler me on 10 rivers.
[00:19:26] Jack six. Interesting. Um I'm going to be falling. might raise something like king six
[00:19:32] versus cut off although people are probably ring c betting but I don't think we want to
[00:19:38] expand that that's wise uh recreational
[00:19:45] possible short stacker preserve with the check on a high boards I like to play check a lot to see for them to to tell
[00:19:53] me what they have check pretty fast now what's the higher EV like letting him bluff off the river
[00:20:02] or betting myself and denying if he has some like a pocket pair with a spade or something like that. I think betting
[00:20:08] myself is better now. Fast check. We're going to go for over
[00:20:14] bet here. We only lose to sixes, I think. So,
[00:20:20] yeah, let's go for it.
[00:20:25] Okay. Interesting. He slow plays. Nice answer.
[00:20:31] He called pretty fast. Like check turns pretty fast, call turn pretty fast. Like that's that's almost never going to be a
[00:20:37] jack holding here.
[00:20:46] And don't we also don't rep. So if he's thinking we might even get an over call like he's going to call any ace
[00:20:52] probably. So and then some pairs maybe.
[00:21:00] Because if he had a jack or a flush throw, he would have bet the flop. So he might uh call us wider because of that
[00:21:06] reason. That's why I went for the bigger size.
[00:21:12] Okay, raising here always with a flush. Uh let's see his stat 218. Yeah, seems
[00:21:19] good. We have back to our street draw as well with our flush draw.
[00:21:24] If I had something like queen deuce, queen three, queen four, even king deuce, king three would be
[00:21:30] better check calls. We don't have back door straight draws and like we can call more turns. We can get like top pairs on
[00:21:37] the turns and stuff.
[00:21:46] Okay, against a possible rig. Going to check this one.
[00:21:56] High board rags shouldn't stab that often. So, we're going to get to the turn node
[00:22:02] way more often than we would if if the board was lower. So,
[00:22:08] we could check more. Uh here going to be calling. I don't like this. I don't like the spot because if he had a bluff
[00:22:16] potentially would would bluff the bluff queen king queen jackx. Yeah, he could
[00:22:22] he could put he could check a weak jackex. Yeah, for the price I think we need to call. But uh yeah, I don't love
[00:22:28] it
[00:22:43] 97. Okay. Interesting that he was thinking
[00:22:48] of value betting. This could be a good exploitative value bet
[00:22:55] because like most of my range is like 10x there.
[00:23:01] So I'm surprised that I was thinking about it usually like on 200 people snap check back there.
[00:23:12] Okay. Ace king export probably playing over better check. We're against the
[00:23:17] rag, I guess. Turn six. We have two recreationals, possible recreationals here. So, I'm
[00:23:22] going to open checking the turn. Delaying
[00:23:29] weak ace pocket deuces and stuff like that.
[00:23:34] Going to be calling here. 76 deep plays pretty well.
[00:23:46] pretty fast bet. We could raise this. We could call. The the the way he he he bet
[00:23:52] so fast. I I lean towards call and it's like CO versus hijack. So might have a
[00:23:58] naturally tighter range and folding here. I block some of the
[00:24:04] bluffs. People won't bluff pairing rivers. This is always an ace.
[00:24:10] Okay. He he checked the eight on the turn. So he might have ace king or what
[00:24:18] am I just blocking here to be honest trying to make ace king or a jack fold
[00:24:24] ace 10. Okay. So the read for three betting pre flop wasn't uh
[00:24:32] wasn't good based on his stats but um yeah sometimes those stats can be
[00:24:37] misleading against these Asian players like they they over I think they overvalue ace high hands
[00:24:45] hands I meant cuz that hand is never a pre flop three bet from those positions
[00:24:50] and you saw his stats stats doesn't indicate that he has that types of hands in his range
[00:24:59] But yeah, once he checks the turn there, mostly give up ace kings, ace jacks, king queens, ace
[00:25:07] queens. And we don't need to be good often on the river to fold out ace kings. So I think block block is good.
[00:25:14] He probably has to bluff catch ace king some of the time as well here against BB3. Bet nothing to do then fold I
[00:25:21] believe.
[00:25:43] Okay. In different hand to open. We're going to open it here.
[00:25:52] A6 boards. You know the drill delaying everything.
[00:26:03] of course really tight big blinds
[00:26:09] but most of the other table seems regy so don't want to open that here just
[00:26:14] going to be folding again I would if I would be playing these games I would note that he's using 75 on the turn here
[00:26:21] this is a clear huge or better check spot so with that note I might start playing
[00:26:29] flop differently. You know, if I expect people to bet more often, let's say he
[00:26:35] has ace ace9, like a weak ace, Ace9, ace8, ace 10 in those spots against
[00:26:40] that, I want to bet more often on the flop, I believe, because then he's going
[00:26:46] to be betting the turn more and I'm going to re I'm going to realize less of my equity.
[00:27:00] I mean, he would continue flop with those hands anyways, so it will probably end up being the same.
[00:27:08] Ace5 not continuing versus 2.5.
[00:27:20] Okay, we see a tank open 51% ATS. So definitely tributing this one.
[00:27:39] Starting with the C bet. He has to be raising some low pocket bears.
[00:27:47] Opening this one.
[00:27:57] Okay, this one probably going to go bet check bet.
[00:28:03] I do block some t and ace with a heart. That might call the turn, but
[00:28:08] check. Actually, I'm going to go for it.
[00:28:15] I think he's going to have way more pocket pairs even without a heart on the flop and not raise them. That's why I went for the bet on the turn.
[00:28:25] Okay, pretty fast check on the turn. Going to delay aggressively
[00:28:30] while betting my five.
[00:28:40] Interesting. Snap check and then raise.
[00:28:47] So I might hit pocket sevens, pocket eights here, but I'm going to call for one
[00:28:57] here. We see a rag here. Would be interesting if he bombs it
[00:29:03] here. Think I'm going to call this spot. Like sevens and eights aren't betting anymore, but what are his buffs? Maybe
[00:29:10] maybe he maybe he revert the queen here. I block fives which is the most obvious
[00:29:16] hand that will play like this 10 suited.
[00:29:26] All right. 76 people are more more trappy on on 50
[00:29:31] than L than 200. What what's what's up with that?
[00:29:45] and Milky on the river.
[00:29:52] He should always always over bet his hand. Make target my range. That's over pairs and 10x.
[00:30:00] So, he lost value there. There's my overall range against my hand. He got max value. So, well played.
[00:30:07] checking here.
[00:30:13] So, we we're live for like 30 minutes. Let's go for like five more minutes, then we can wrap it up a bit.
[00:30:23] Okay. Going to delay here. Something like 40% is good. Don't want to go too big because big big blind might be in
[00:30:31] theory he might be uncapped cuz I'm going to reopen a lot on a king. So he should check a lot of his forex but
[00:30:36] people will mostly see like double flush throw board. I have to bet my hand for protection. They will bet it. So in here
[00:30:42] you can delay for B75 easily there I think.
[00:30:49] Okay range check trips board easiest to play. He's going to have 97 off. He's going to
[00:30:56] have 98 off. We won't open sometimes that
[00:31:03] uh against a bigger size. We do less raising overall. Uh our Jack does need
[00:31:08] protection, but I think just going to call without a spade.
[00:31:16] See what he does on the turn. Raising here.
[00:31:22] I think I'm going to check I'm going to check this. He should reopen an eight a lot.
[00:31:32] He should reopen an eight a lot. So I think he's mostly going to be like kind of bluff heavy once he uses a big size.
[00:31:38] Yeah, you see random stuff. He's going to be bluff heavy once he uses a a big size on the flop and then checks the turn. That's why I didn't want to block.
[00:31:45] I think in theory you want to bet there because some of his range improves on a seven like 76. But um
[00:31:52] the way how he used the bigger size and then check the turn made made me want to made me think is he's air heavy. So
[00:31:59] that's why I didn't want to bet.
[00:32:07] People are doing really really big three bet sizings here as well. That's weird.
[00:32:15] Basically every time people go more than 3x you just play four better or fold. You don't want to p like you don't want
[00:32:21] to um reward
[00:32:27] their strategy especially if they have tight ranges like that example UTG versus a cutoff.
[00:32:35] So just for blocker hands ace queen ace king
[00:32:40] a5 sometimes and then fold the other uh queen six to this this actually a fold
[00:32:46] in equilibrium but I'm going to call suited hand can't be too bad. Probably
[00:32:53] losing slight like 0.01 BB
[00:32:58] 0.02 something like that. It's going to be falling here. We do have a vector but it's too wide to to peel.
[00:33:06] Rain check here.
[00:33:17] I'll be raising my hand for both for value and both for denial with queen of diamonds. I think it's a good play.
[00:33:30] Like most people would just check call here, but even in interior, I think this is a this a play.
[00:33:39] And even more in practice, I would believe because most people would, if they have value there, they would uh
[00:33:46] let's open this against this recreational. If they had value in that spot, they would probably size up because they want to get they want to
[00:33:53] charge my ace heights, right? They wouldn't use a smaller size.
[00:34:00] So, that even makes me makes me think even more that he's air heavy. And we're
[00:34:06] just denying equity against that range with raising ace queen there.
[00:34:16] Holding here. Holding here.
[00:34:34] Nice. Oh, what's the best way to play this? This guy has zero hands played.
[00:34:40] So, I think I'm going to go for a smaller three bit.
[00:34:45] Four bet. Sorry.
[00:34:54] Ace king. Let's not rise once
[00:35:01] here. Going to start with the bigger bet. There's a lot of gunshots.
[00:35:15] Nice.
[00:35:24] Okay, let's see out next big blind. We won like stock and a bit. Two times we
[00:35:30] have kings. We won two pots. That's nice.
[00:35:36] Global sit out. Okay, let's finish the video and wrap it up here. 86
[00:35:45] 1711 going be not going to be opening there. This guy's 64 VIP. He's him seems like
[00:35:54] we're calling. I think the best play against this player is to check because it's going to be really white and then
[00:36:00] check call against or even check race the race of course
[00:36:07] let's check call and jam on the river here basically
[00:36:12] we're targeting two pair region once he goes B50 on the turn and sizes up on the river means he's usually going to be
[00:36:20] stronger so we don't want to raise small and and get value from king nine or or ajack Whatever. We want to raise big and
[00:36:26] get value from two pair. That's how you maximize this spot.
[00:36:35] Wow, we had same hands. Oh, I think climatic climactic ending. But uh
[00:36:42] yeah, that that's it. Uh wait, we didn't uh we didn't
[00:36:49] end the left table here. But yeah, that's that spot on the on the
[00:36:55] left was uh we just want to maximize every time he has two pair. Every time he has sets, right? If we jam, in
[00:37:00] theory, all his sets, all his two pairs are indifferent. In practice, no one's going to fold that. Not not even strong res, right? Maybe like the top top top
[00:37:08] regs would, but people usually value their two pairs. Like you already know
[00:37:14] what I like to to to say in all of my videos. This is like the basic of value
[00:37:19] betting. every time when the guy has like cooler hand, you want to maximize against that. And that's pretty much it.
[00:37:25] All right, this was it for this video. Hope you guys liked it. Like, like and subscribe. And uh yeah, if you like more
