Play&explain R&C200

Hand 1:
Luke 3-bets (small, eg min-click, that's his tyle of 3-bets he's familiar with) QdJd, CO 4-bets, Luke calls.

Flop 6cTd3h B40/C
Turn Ts X/X ("I don't block the Tx so i give up with those exact suits")
River 3s X/? "Villian played this hand well so far, no clear tells when it comes to sizings or timings, I have a clear bet, and I don't have another sizing but all in. Defintely can't check back here, if I've got 88 it's worth all in, I put his AK/AQ in a tough spot" - shoved all in, villian tanked-fold

Hand 2:
HJ opens, CO calls, luke calls with KdJh.
Flop Ad4dJd X/X/X
Turn 2h Luke overbets into 2 player ($17 into $13)- "I will bet here with a hand that can improve in number of ways eg any diamond,K,J, by overbetting multiway i force them to fold a naked Ax on this connected texture"

Hand 3:
Luke 3-bets a recreational with Jc9c (his 3-bet sizing is a min-click) and get got min-click 4-bet by a professional player, he folded despite getting great pot odds, as the pro represents a very very strong range

Hand 4:
Luke 3-bets KdKc as BB vs sb open
Flop comes AhJhJs X/B33/C
Turn 3s X/X
River Ad "I have a good bluffcatcher, I unblock all his underpairs that he's going to have" 
sb X, Luke about his thought process: "It's pretty hard for him to call worse as I block all his K highs, I would bet here QQ before I bet here KK" checks back

Hand 5:

QsJd as HJ vs LJ limp: "This guy is going to be weaker. 100-0 over five hands
Very easy iso  for me. Going to make it large cuz
I want to isolate everyone else out of
 the pots. 

Flop comes 6c,2s7d 
"Queen Jack is a bet" X/B33/C 
Turn 3c X/? "Not liking the turn barrel here. He's not going to fold some random pair to the board like pocket fives, pocket fours because they pick up gut shots. So we're going to surrender the hand- but not completely. Let's just say I'm going to check the
 turn. Evaluate river.
 River Qd X/?
  "That makes my life quite easy.  We have just a very clear target to some pair on the board. We're not targeting ace high calls. So, we're just going to go with a size that he realistically doesn't fold random pairs to, which is this - bets 32$ into 46$ villian folds 


Hand 6:

Same player (100 vpip) limps, Luke isos with 6c3c as HJ to $10: 

"Very loose. Why am I going to go so loose in these early positions? Like, I wouldn't open the hand, Now, I'm raising it cuz this guy is super super loose. He's playing way too many hands here. So, I want to get involved. Let's go with a small sizing  and see what he does. Timing sizing from him. He Snap fold. Great. But if he snap called, that would be indicative of quite a weak hand. We could potentially barrel. "


This guy is a professional, so
[00:08:36] I'm not going to raise. Also, make sure
[00:08:39] you're noting. By the way, I've just
[00:08:40] realized I've not done that, which is
[00:08:42] really bad of me. This guy is a target
[00:08:44] for us. Okay, 100 VPIP. We are wanting
[00:08:47] to get involved with that player. So,
[00:08:49] let's tag him so I can easily identify
[00:08:51] him if I see him again.
[00:08:53] 10 big blinds. We're a bit deeper. Let's
[00:08:55] roll this one for one in four. We are
[00:08:57] calling this time. You can't see the
[00:08:59] RNG. You just have to trust me. AceJ.
[00:09:03] Sure. SP bet in about 40%.
[00:09:07] Ace9.
[00:09:10] Okay. AceJ. Here we block the queen
[00:09:12] jack. Maybe ace queen offsuit. I'm going
[00:09:14] to put a second barrel in here and then
[00:09:16] give up the river. Uh calling flop.
[00:09:20] That's a great turn.
[00:09:24] This is very marginal, by the way. This
[00:09:25] ace jack,
[00:09:28] it's just marginal. I should have RNGed
[00:09:29] it really. I bet the flop, his timing
[00:09:32] was fine, so I really shouldn't be
[00:09:35] betting that one every time. I've got no
[00:09:36] excuse to find that one every time, to
[00:09:37] be honest. Ace9 here versus 2/3. Please
[00:09:40] give me this time bank chip. I've got
[00:09:43] some PDSD from last video. Um, I guess
[00:09:45] we're just going to press call here. You
[00:09:46] can also min raise,
[00:09:50] which I am going to do. I think min
[00:09:51] raising is quite good here. This is not
[00:09:54] exploitive. I think this is a fine
[00:09:55] theoretical play. Think about your
[00:09:58] value. The bottom of your value range
[00:10:00] there for a min raise is basically ace
[00:10:02] king if not a nine. And you wouldn't
[00:10:05] want to raise boats. So basically,
[00:10:06] you're telling villain you've got a
[00:10:07] little bit of ace king that didn't raise
[00:10:09] pre or on the flop or a turned nine. So
[00:10:12] that raising range does not need to
[00:10:14] raise very big. At the same time, a min
[00:10:16] raise really puts him in a horrible
[00:10:18] situation. So I like the decision there.
[00:10:20] Had I had more time, I would have
[00:10:22] probably mixed it. Okay, professional in
[00:10:24] the small blinds. Most likely we will
[00:10:27] just mix this up. We'll check this time.
[00:10:29] Don't really care for being perfect.
[00:10:32] It's just want I want to have my jack in
[00:10:34] the betting and checking lane because I
[00:10:36] simply don't think betting is better
[00:10:37] than checking or vice versa.
[00:10:41] Big three bet from probably a regular.
[00:10:44] I'm He's 15114 but over 60 hands which
[00:10:48] is not enough of a sample. The fact that
[00:10:49] he's gone so big is very indicative of a
[00:10:51] regular. Uh calling the jack eight here
[00:10:55] and very good river. We do block some
[00:10:57] bluffs, but not too many cuz he's a
[00:11:00] small blind, not big blind. Mop open.
[00:11:02] This is going to be a recreational
[00:11:03] player, so we're going to be very, very
[00:11:05] exploitative in this hand, especially on
[00:11:07] this board. He bets again. I don't think
[00:11:10] I can do anything but call here. If I
[00:11:12] fold, I'm insinuating he's got a strong
[00:11:15] top pair or better more than 75% of the
[00:11:17] time, which is very unlikely. He's even
[00:11:19] valuating worse somehow. Uh 83, I'm
[00:11:22] going to go small. In theory, you're
[00:11:23] supposed to size up, but by going small,
[00:11:26] I get a lot of information on his
[00:11:28] decision because if he's got a strong
[00:11:30] hand, he's going to want to raise. If if
[00:11:33] I go big though, he might check call
[00:11:34] stronger hands.
[00:11:39] So I get more information essentially.
[00:11:42] Ace king. We're going to be three
[00:11:44] betting
[00:11:46] to 10. We're a bit deeper here.
[00:11:49] Definitely going to be calling
[00:11:50] recreational small blind short stack big
[00:11:52] blind. I'm involved every time.
[00:11:55] Let's swap a set. Let's go multi-way. I
[00:11:58] have a professional to my right. I've
[00:11:59] seen him a few times now. So definitely
[00:12:01] a guy to pay attention to. Deuces. Never
[00:12:04] betting here. Fun fact, you would want
[00:12:06] to bet deuces without a diamond more
[00:12:08] than with a diamond because without a
[00:12:10] diamond, your hand is just really,
[00:12:11] really, really bad. It wants to kind of
[00:12:12] bluff. With a diamond, you have some
[00:12:14] extra equity in the checking line. If
[00:12:17] you bet and you hit your flush, you
[00:12:19] don't really hit a flush. You've got the
[00:12:20] lowest flush draw, right? So, yes, you
[00:12:23] do technically a flush here, but you
[00:12:24] can't value bet. So, you'd rather take
[00:12:26] it as a check and pick up some extra
[00:12:27] free cards. Ace king getting cold. Four
[00:12:29] bet. Very small, although my obviously
[00:12:32] my three bet small. Nice river here. Um,
[00:12:34] okay. Okay, deeper. We are 125ish. He's
[00:12:37] gone 14. I am going to play uh a four
[00:12:40] bet here.
[00:12:42] A five bet actually.
[00:12:45] And D is obviously betting. We'll go
[00:12:48] half pot. Seems fine. Just going to pick
[00:12:50] off a bunch of random calls from big
[00:12:51] blind here. So, we are five betting to
[00:12:54] 32 and a half. We get shoved. Okay.
[00:12:56] Well, I believe him.
[00:12:58] I think sixes is a fine call. Um yeah,
[00:13:02] kind of a shame. The reason why I went
[00:13:04] with this five bet by the way every
[00:13:05] time, this is not just for the video or
[00:13:08] being over aggressive. The reason was he
[00:13:10] went with the small call for bet sizing.
[00:13:11] And from my experience as someone who's
[00:13:13] used these small three bets often,
[00:13:15] people can sometimes
[00:13:18] size their value hands to the regular
[00:13:21] sizing of let's say 22 big blinds and
[00:13:23] then their bluffs smaller. So on
[00:13:26] average, those smaller sizings end up
[00:13:28] being a bit weaker. King Jack here
[00:13:30] against a
[00:13:33] regular. Okay, so this guy's a short
[00:13:34] stack pro. Interesting.
[00:13:37] Going to note that down.
[00:13:39] I'll take my free card then. I didn't
[00:13:42] think he was professional. That's why
[00:13:43] I'm needing to look at these things.
[00:13:46] Going to isolate versus this player.
[00:13:48] This guy's definitely weaker. Bets the
[00:13:50] turn one/3.
[00:13:53] Quite like raising here.
[00:14:04] This is just an underprotected line.
[00:14:06] This check flop block turn. It's Yeah,
[00:14:08] it's underprotected. So, I think we have
[00:14:11] a pretty easy raise. Exploitatively. I
[00:14:12] think my play is good in theory.
[00:14:15] So, if he's folding a bit too much, it's
[00:14:17] going to be even better and probably the
[00:14:19] best play.
[00:14:21] Going to check the turn and 97 will open
[00:14:24] into the short stack big blind. very
[00:14:26] lucky this video so far running a bit
[00:14:28] hot. Um
[00:14:30] I will go with a large sizing here
[00:14:32] because there's a there's a chance he's
[00:14:33] got a king that doesn't bet cuz the
[00:14:35] river river pairs river pairs. Sorry. So
[00:14:38] on the chance that he doesn't I think he
[00:14:41] has the king.
[00:14:43] Yeah. Wow. Very lucky river. Thank god
[00:14:45] no heart came. Yeah. He had that king
[00:14:48] that was probably going to value bet.
[00:14:49] Saw the four. Got over scared.
[00:14:52] Realistically how many fours do I have?
[00:14:54] Not that many, but let's say he freaked
[00:14:58] himself out a little bit. 54. We're
[00:15:00] going to get Lucy Goosey here in three
[00:15:01] bets. Should be mixing this one, but
[00:15:03] hey, we're recording a video for YouTube
[00:15:04] here, so let's get involved. Get called
[00:15:06] for immediately. I just can't call. I
[00:15:09] probably can. I'm getting infinite to
[00:15:10] one here. 53 is going to be calling.
[00:15:14] Very interesting flop. All right. Three
[00:15:16] hearts dealer.
[00:15:18] Oh, it's not quite what I was wanting.
[00:15:22] Checking a muck. 5-3 drawing to the Wow,
[00:15:25] the nut shot. Unbelievable. We're
[00:15:27] definitely just going to go for the
[00:15:29] check here and pray cut off bets into us
[00:15:34] because we need to we need to put money
[00:15:37] in, right? This is very unlikely that
[00:15:39] I'm losing the hand. So, don't get
[00:15:40] worried about the diamond cuz who has
[00:15:42] two diamonds in the hand? I don't think
[00:15:44] either player has two diamonds unless
[00:15:45] they've got like queens and a diamonds
[00:15:46] here. So, I'm going to check again and
[00:15:49] go for a check raise. I'm again I'm not
[00:15:50] worried about the flush.
[00:15:54] Uh well, now I'm a bit worried about the
[00:15:57] flush.
[00:15:59] Yeah. And he's 3333,
[00:16:02] so he looks to be a bit wy and nitty.
[00:16:04] I'm obviously not folding, by the way,
[00:16:05] just to be uh clear. But I don't think I
[00:16:10] can raise against him.
[00:16:15] Also, if I call, he might call an ace
[00:16:16] behind as well. Oh, good guy. The good
[00:16:18] guy called. Um, it's funny how I just
[00:16:20] spoke to you guys about I'm going to
[00:16:22] check fold this, by the way. Snap or pot
[00:16:24] here. Pot stab. I'm I'm done. I don't
[00:16:26] expect to get bluffed much in this
[00:16:28] situation. This is a really good hand to
[00:16:29] talk about. It's really important to
[00:16:33] update your thoughts as the hand is
[00:16:35] going on. Realistically, the PFR doesn't
[00:16:39] have two diamonds because he had a
[00:16:40] chance to bet the flop, bet the turn,
[00:16:43] bet the river. Well, we hadn't seen the
[00:16:45] river bet. So, he had a chance to bet
[00:16:46] the flop, bet the turn. He didn't choose
[00:16:47] to do that. And if you watch back the
[00:16:49] video, you'll notice that he checked
[00:16:51] quite fast as well. So realistically,
[00:16:53] this Zen 1995 is very, very unlikely to
[00:16:57] have a better hand than us to the point
[00:16:58] where if we checked and he bet big, I'm
[00:17:00] happy to raise for value here. I'm not
[00:17:02] freaked out about the third diamond. And
[00:17:04] the same was going to be true for the
[00:17:06] button as well, cuz the button also, if
[00:17:08] you watch back the video, did check back
[00:17:10] quite fast. So versus a bet I was
[00:17:12] intending to raise, yet I didn't raise
[00:17:15] for two reasons. The first one is that
[00:17:17] obviously he sized up, but that's not
[00:17:19] the only reason. The second one is that
[00:17:20] the guy's playing 333. So 33 V pip is
[00:17:24] quite why. Three and three pfr attempt
[00:17:28] to steal. Basically he's why but also
[00:17:31] nitty. He doesn't like raising. He
[00:17:33] doesn't like betting. He's very passive
[00:17:35] player. Whe players can be aggressive or
[00:17:38] they can be passive. It depends on how
[00:17:39] they play post flop. So he's Wy pre flop
[00:17:41] passive post flop. So I updated my
[00:17:44] thoughts. He's gone from being a
[00:17:46] standard recreational that checked twice
[00:17:48] and therefore I'm going to target him
[00:17:49] and check raise to actually a nitty
[00:17:51] recreational who potted the river after
[00:17:54] checking back flop and turn. So unless
[00:17:55] he's got a hand like pocket nines, I
[00:17:58] need to just call the river and not
[00:17:59] raise. Obviously, we can't fold here.
[00:18:01] There's no way that we could ever
[00:18:02] exploit fold this situation because he
[00:18:04] could also just have two nines or three
[00:18:06] nines.
