Play&explain R&C200

Hand 1:
Luke 3-bets (small, eg min-click, that's his tyle of 3-bets he's familiar with) QdJd, CO 4-bets, Luke calls.

Flop 6cTd3h B40/C
Turn Ts X/X ("I don't block the Tx so i give up with those exact suits")
River 3s X/? "Villian played this hand well so far, no clear tells when it comes to sizings or timings, I have a clear bet, and I don't have another sizing but all in. Defintely can't check back here, if I've got 88 it's worth all in, I put his AK/AQ in a tough spot" - shoved all in, villian tanked-fold

Hand 2:
HJ opens, CO calls, luke calls with KdJh.
Flop Ad4dJd X/X/X
Turn 2h Luke overbets into 2 player ($17 into $13)- "I will bet here with a hand that can improve in number of ways eg any diamond,K,J, by overbetting multiway i force them to fold a naked Ax on this connected texture"

Hand 3:
Luke 3-bets a recreational with Jc9c (his 3-bet sizing is a min-click) and get got min-click 4-bet by a professional player, he folded despite getting great pot odds, as the pro represents a very very strong range

Hand 4:
Luke 3-bets KdKc as BB vs sb open
Flop comes AhJhJs X/B33/C
Turn 3s X/X
River Ad "I have a good bluffcatcher, I unblock all his underpairs that he's going to have" 
sb X, Luke about his thought process: "It's pretty hard for him to call worse as I block all his K highs, I would bet here QQ before I bet here KK" checks back

Hand 5:

QsJd as HJ vs LJ limp: "This guy is going to be weaker. 100-0 over five hands
Very easy iso  for me. Going to make it large cuz
I want to isolate everyone else out of
 the pots. 

Flop comes 6c,2s7d 
"Queen Jack is a bet" X/B33/C 
Turn 3c X/? "Not liking the turn barrel here. He's not going to fold some random pair to the board like pocket fives, pocket fours because they pick up gut shots. So we're going to surrender the hand- but not completely. Let's just say I'm going to check the
 turn. Evaluate river.
 River Qd X/?
  "That makes my life quite easy.  We have just a very clear target to some pair on the board. We're not targeting ace high calls. So, we're just going to go with a size that he realistically doesn't fold random pairs to, which is this - bets 32$ into 46$ villian folds 


Hand 6:

Same player (100 vpip) limps, Luke isos with 6c3c as HJ to $10: 

"Very loose. Why am I going to go so loose in these early positions? Like, I wouldn't open the hand, Now, I'm raising it cuz this guy is super super loose. He's playing way too many hands here. So, I want to get involved. Let's go with a small sizing  and see what he does. Timing sizing from him. He Snap fold. Great. But if he snap called, that would be indicative of quite a weak hand. We could potentially barrel. "

Hand 7:

Luke opens Jh8h from HJ, sb calls.

Flop comes 4cJd2s X/? Luke: "probably mixed it. Okay, professional in
the small blinds. Most likely we will just mix this up. We'll check this time. Don't really care for being perfect. It's just want I want to have my jack in the betting and checking lane because I simply don't think betting is better than checking or vice versa."

checks back.
Turn Tc sb goes B75 

Luke:  "Uh calling the jack eight here"
Luke calls.

River 4s
: "and very good river. We do block some bluffs, but not too many cuz he's a small blind, not big blind" SB B50, luke "He bets again. I don't think  I can do anything but call here. If I  fold, I'm insinuating he's got a strong  top pair or better more than 75% of the  time, which is very unlikely." Luke calls, SB has QdTd 

Hand 8:
Luke with 8s3s as BB vs a sb 2BB open:
"This is going to be a recreational player, so we're going to be very, very exploitative in this hand- a 2BB open from sb is going to be a recreational player most of the time" , 

Flop comes 2d5h6s, sb checks. Luke bets B30:

"Uh 83, I'm going to go small. In theory, you're supposed to size up, but by going small, I get a lot of information on his decision because if he's got a strong  hand, he's going to want to raise. 
if I go big though, he might check call  stronger hands. So I get more information essentially."
sb folded


Hand 9:

Luke is in BU with 2d2c, CO (a professional) opens, Luke: I'm definitely going to be calling. Recreational small blind short stack big blind. I'm involved every time. Let's flop a set. Let's go multi-way. I have a professional to my right. I've  seen him a few times now. So definitely  a guy to pay attention to". 

Flop comes 9d5d3d X/X/?
Luke: Deuces. Never betting here. Fun fact, you would want  to bet deuces without a diamond more than with a diamond because without a diamond, your hand is just really,  really, really bad. It wants to kind of  bluff. With a diamond, you have some extra equity in the checking line. If you bet and you hit your flush, you don't really hit a flush. You've got the  lowest flush draw, right? So, yes, you do technically a flush here, but you  can't value bet. So, you'd rather take it as a check and pick up some extra free cards". Note: i've checked in GTOW and indeed the betting frequency without a diamond is higher, and the equity of the 22 with no diamon is lower.

check back flop

Turn Qs X/X/X
River 2h, X/X Luke:"22 are obviously betting here. We're going to go half pot", bets B50, BB folds, CO calls with 6d6c



Hand 10:

Luke calls as BB with KhJs, flop comes 
7c3h6h X/?,
villian has a 50 BB stack but has a reg stats (24-19-11-41 on 511). Luke:
"Okay, so this guy's a short stack pro. Interesting. Going to note that down. I'll take my free card then. I didn't think he was professional. That's why I'm needing to look at these things." checks back.

Turn 2s, sb bets B33, Luke raises(!) to $18.
Luke: Quite like raising here, I'm taking what is already good in theory (infrequently raise) and doing it exploitatively too often,attacking villian's precieved weakness. So, if he's folding a bit too much, it's going to be even better and probably the best play".
sb folds.


Hand 11:

Luke has QcJs from BB, CO fish limps, Luke raises to 6BB, CO calls.

Flop AhQh5s X/ CO goes pot. Luke:" I'm going to  fold this, by the way. Snap bet pot here. Pot stab. I'm done. I don't expect to get bluffed much in this situation." Folds.

Hand 12:

Luke calls 5s3s from BB vs open from CO and call from BU.

Flop comes 4dAdQs X/X/X
Turn 2h X/X/X
River 9d, luke checked intending to X/R his straight, because realisticly, both players needed to check diamons on flop and turn for him to lose to a flush. However, BU pot it, Luke looked at his stats. He is a passive whale (33-3-3 so a very passive and nitty whale), so therefore decided against X/R the river. Can never fold as the whale could have something like 99, but can't raise either. Luke called. Whale showed the nuts (Kd7d).
It's important to update our thoughts (initially Luke wanted to X/R) based on actions (villian pot it which was worrying, looking at villian's stats he is a passive whale).
