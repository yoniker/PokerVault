Play&explain R&C200

Hand 1:
Luke 3-bets (small, eg min-click, that's his tyle of 3-bets he's familiar with) QdJd, CO 4-bets, Luke calls.

Flop 6cTd3h B40/C
Turn Ts X/X ("I don't block the Tx so i give up with those exact suits")
River 3s X/? "Villian played this hand well so far, no clear tells when it comes to sizings or timings, I have a clear bet, and I don't have another sizing but all in. Defintely can't check back here, if I've got 88 it's worth all in, I put his AK/AQ in a tough spot" - shoved all in, villian tanked-fold

Hand 2:
HJ opens, CO calls, luke calls with KdJh.
Flop Ad4dJd X/X/X
Turn 2h Luke overbets into 2 player ($17 into $13)- "I will bet here with a hand that can improve in number of ways eg any diamond,K,J, by overbetting multiway i force them to fold a naked Ax on this connected texture"

Hand 3:
Luke 3-bets a recreational with Jc9c (his 3-bet sizing is a min-click) and get got min-click 4-bet by a professional player, he folded despite getting great pot odds, as the pro represents a very very strong range

Hand 4:
Luke 3-bets KdKc as BB vs sb open
Flop comes AhJhJs X/B33/C
Turn 3s X/X
River Ad "I have a good bluffcatcher, I unblock all his underpairs that he's going to have" 
sb X, Luke about his thought process: "It's pretty hard for him to call worse as I block all his K highs, I would bet here QQ before I bet here KK" checks back

Hand 5:

QsJd as HJ vs LJ limp: "This guy is going to be weaker. 100-0 over five hands
Very easy iso  for me. Going to make it large cuz
I want to isolate everyone else out of
 the pots. 

Flop comes 6c,2s7d 
"Queen Jack is a bet" X/B33/C 
Turn 3c X/? "Not liking the turn barrel here. He's not going to fold some random pair to the board like pocket fives, pocket fours because they pick up gut shots. So we're going to surrender the hand- but not completely. Let's just say I'm going to check the
 turn. Evaluate river.
 River Qd X/?
  "That makes my life quite easy.  We have just a very clear target to some pair on the board. We're not targeting ace high calls. So, we're just going to go with a size that he realistically doesn't fold random pairs to, which is this - bets 32$ into 46$ villian folds 


Hand 6:

Same player (100 vpip) limps, Luke isos with 6c3c as HJ to $10: 

"Very loose. Why am I going to go so loose in these early positions? Like, I wouldn't open the hand, Now, I'm raising it cuz this guy is super super loose. He's playing way too many hands here. So, I want to get involved. Let's go with a small sizing  and see what he does. Timing sizing from him. He Snap fold. Great. But if he snap called, that would be indicative of quite a weak hand. We could potentially barrel. "

Hand 7:

Luke opens Jh8h from HJ, sb calls.

Flop comes 4cJd2s X/? Luke: "probably mixed it. Okay, professional in
the small blinds. Most likely we will just mix this up. We'll check this time. Don't really care for being perfect. It's just want I want to have my jack in the betting and checking lane because I simply don't think betting is better than checking or vice versa."

checks back.
Turn Tc sb goes B75 

Luke:  "Uh calling the jack eight here"
Luke calls.

River 4s
: "and very good river. We do block some bluffs, but not too many cuz he's a small blind, not big blind" SB B50, luke "He bets again. I don't think  I can do anything but call here. If I  fold, I'm insinuating he's got a strong  top pair or better more than 75% of the  time, which is very unlikely." Luke calls, SB has QdTd 

Hand 8:
Luke with 8s3s as BB vs a sb 2BB open:
"This is going to be a recreational player, so we're going to be very, very exploitative in this hand- a 2BB open from sb is going to be a recreational player most of the time" , 

Flop comes 2d5h6s, sb checks. Luke bets B30:

"Uh 83, I'm going to go small. In theory, you're supposed to size up, but by going small, I get a lot of information on his decision because if he's got a strong  hand, he's going to want to raise. 
if I go big though, he might check call  stronger hands. So I get more information essentially."
sb folded


Hand 9:

Luke is in BU with 2d2c, CO (a professional) opens, Luke: I'm definitely going to be calling. Recreational small blind short stack big blind. I'm involved every time. Let's flop a set. Let's go multi-way. I have a professional to my right. I've  seen him a few times now. So definitely  a guy to pay attention to". 

Flop comes 9d5d2d X/X/?
Luke: Deuces. Never betting here. Fun fact, you would want  to bet deuces without a diamond more than with a diamond because without a diamond, your hand is just really,  really, really bad. It wants to kind of  bluff. With a diamond, you have some extra equity in the checking line. If you bet and you hit your flush, you don't really hit a flush. You've got the  lowest flush draw, right? So, yes, you do technically a flush here, but you  can't value bet. So, you'd rather take it as a check and pick up some extra free cards". Note: i've checked in GTOW and indeed the betting frequency without a diamond is higher, and the equity of the 22 with no diamon is lower.

check back flop

Turn Qs X/X/X
River 2h, X/X Luke:"22 are obviously betting here. We're going to go half pot", bets B50, BB folds, CO calls with 6d6c



Hand 10:

Luke calls as BB with KhJs, flop comes 
7c3h6h X/?,
villian has a 50 BB stack but has a reg stats (24-19-11-41 on 511). Luke:
"Okay, so this guy's a short stack pro. Interesting. Going to note that down. I'll take my free card then. I didn't think he was professional. That's why I'm needing to look at these things." checks back.

Turn 2s, sb bets B33, Luke raises(!) to $18.
Luke: Quite like raising here, I'm taking what is already good in theory (infrequently raise) and doing it exploitatively too often,attacking villian's precieved weakness. So, if he's folding a bit too much, it's going to be even better and probably the best play".
sb folds.


Hand 11:


[00:13:46] Going to isolate versus this player.
[00:13:48] This guy's definitely weaker. Bets the
[00:13:50] turn one/3.
 
[00:14:04] This is just an underprotected line.
[00:14:06] This check flop block turn. It's Yeah,
[00:14:08] it's underprotected. So, I think we have
[00:14:11] a pretty easy raise. Exploitatively. I
[00:14:12] think my play is good in theory.
[00:14:15] 
[00:14:17] 
[00:14:19] best play.
[00:14:21] Going to check the turn and 97 will open
[00:14:24] into the short stack big blind. very
[00:14:26] lucky this video so far running a bit
[00:14:28] hot. Um
[00:14:30] I will go with a large sizing here
[00:14:32] because there's a there's a chance he's
[00:14:33] got a king that doesn't bet cuz the
[00:14:35] river river pairs river pairs. Sorry. So
[00:14:38] on the chance that he doesn't I think he
[00:14:41] has the king.
[00:14:43] Yeah. Wow. Very lucky river. Thank god
[00:14:45] no heart came. Yeah. He had that king
[00:14:48] that was probably going to value bet.
[00:14:49] Saw the four. Got over scared.
[00:14:52] Realistically how many fours do I have?
[00:14:54] Not that many, but let's say he freaked
[00:14:58] himself out a little bit. 54. We're
[00:15:00] going to get Lucy Goosey here in three
[00:15:01] bets. Should be mixing this one, but
[00:15:03] hey, we're recording a video for YouTube
[00:15:04] here, so let's get involved. Get called
[00:15:06] for immediately. I just can't call. I
[00:15:09] probably can. I'm getting infinite to
[00:15:10] one here. 53 is going to be calling.
[00:15:14] Very interesting flop. All right. Three
[00:15:16] hearts dealer.
[00:15:18] Oh, it's not quite what I was wanting.
[00:15:22] Checking a muck. 5-3 drawing to the Wow,
[00:15:25] the nut shot. Unbelievable. We're
[00:15:27] definitely just going to go for the
[00:15:29] check here and pray cut off bets into us
[00:15:34] because we need to we need to put money
[00:15:37] in, right? This is very unlikely that
[00:15:39] I'm losing the hand. So, don't get
[00:15:40] worried about the diamond cuz who has
[00:15:42] two diamonds in the hand? I don't think
[00:15:44] either player has two diamonds unless
[00:15:45] they've got like queens and a diamonds
[00:15:46] here. So, I'm going to check again and
[00:15:49] go for a check raise. I'm again I'm not
[00:15:50] worried about the flush.
[00:15:54] Uh well, now I'm a bit worried about the
[00:15:57] flush.
[00:15:59] Yeah. And he's 3333,
[00:16:02] so he looks to be a bit wy and nitty.
[00:16:04] I'm obviously not folding, by the way,
[00:16:05] just to be uh clear. But I don't think I
[00:16:10] can raise against him.
[00:16:15] Also, if I call, he might call an ace
[00:16:16] behind as well. Oh, good guy. The good
[00:16:18] guy called. Um, it's funny how I just
[00:16:20] spoke to you guys about I'm going to
[00:16:22] check fold this, by the way. Snap or pot
[00:16:24] here. Pot stab. I'm I'm done. I don't
[00:16:26] expect to get bluffed much in this
[00:16:28] situation. This is a really good hand to
[00:16:29] talk about. It's really important to
[00:16:33] update your thoughts as the hand is
[00:16:35] going on. Realistically, the PFR doesn't
[00:16:39] have two diamonds because he had a
[00:16:40] chance to bet the flop, bet the turn,
[00:16:43] bet the river. Well, we hadn't seen the
[00:16:45] river bet. So, he had a chance to bet
[00:16:46] the flop, bet the turn. He didn't choose
[00:16:47] to do that. And if you watch back the
[00:16:49] video, you'll notice that he checked
[00:16:51] quite fast as well. So realistically,
[00:16:53] this Zen 1995 is very, very unlikely to
[00:16:57] have a better hand than us to the point
[00:16:58] where if we checked and he bet big, I'm
[00:17:00] happy to raise for value here. I'm not
[00:17:02] freaked out about the third diamond. And
[00:17:04] the same was going to be true for the
[00:17:06] button as well, cuz the button also, if
[00:17:08] you watch back the video, did check back
[00:17:10] quite fast. So versus a bet I was
[00:17:12] intending to raise, yet I didn't raise
[00:17:15] for two reasons. The first one is that
[00:17:17] obviously he sized up, but that's not
[00:17:19] the only reason. The second one is that
[00:17:20] the guy's playing 333. So 33 V pip is
[00:17:24] quite why. Three and three pfr attempt
[00:17:28] to steal. Basically he's why but also
[00:17:31] nitty. He doesn't like raising. He
[00:17:33] doesn't like betting. He's very passive
[00:17:35] player. Whe players can be aggressive or
[00:17:38] they can be passive. It depends on how
[00:17:39] they play post flop. So he's Wy pre flop
[00:17:41] passive post flop. So I updated my
[00:17:44] thoughts. He's gone from being a
[00:17:46] standard recreational that checked twice
[00:17:48] and therefore I'm going to target him
[00:17:49] and check raise to actually a nitty
[00:17:51] recreational who potted the river after
[00:17:54] checking back flop and turn. So unless
[00:17:55] he's got a hand like pocket nines, I
[00:17:58] need to just call the river and not
[00:17:59] raise. Obviously, we can't fold here.
[00:18:01] There's no way that we could ever
[00:18:02] exploit fold this situation because he
[00:18:04] could also just have two nines or three
[00:18:06] nines.
