Before 2024, his mental game was bad: His mood was determined by his results because he played stakes that he couldnt handle, so one day he could be at this best, the next one the most miserable player in the world.

His results were great(made 30k in 6 months-6k from BBJ, it's great for playing 25cent/50 cent).
