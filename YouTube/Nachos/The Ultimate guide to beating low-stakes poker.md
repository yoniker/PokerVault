-Study a very specific spot, like defending vs a c-bet in a 3-bet pot in position. Then look at my EV mistakes in that spot and make flushcards out of those mistakes, what made me make those mistakes (I thought this type of hand always defends here but this is an exception etc)



[00:00:02] [Music] hey guys what's up my name is Patrick and I'm going to tell you guys some strategies on how to become a low stakes
[00:00:09] Crusher today which should be pretty exciting um as you can see I'm in an Airbnb right now so the setup that I'm
[00:00:15] using to record is pretty basic um audio might not be perfect and just the
[00:00:20] overall end results quality of the video might not be as good as you're used to having said that I think the content
[00:00:26] will definitely make up for that um as I've prepared a pretty densely uh structured video for you guys
[00:00:33] where there's just a ton of information that you can use on your way to become a low Stak Crusher so in this video I'm
[00:00:39] going to discuss some stuff about goal setting um and how to do that in a way where it's actually effective rather
[00:00:46] than just a goal you set and then forget about and three weeks later you set another goal and uh you rinse and repeat
[00:00:54] that cycle I'm going to show you guys my study plan uh the plan that I used to
[00:01:00] gradually become an um better player every day and uh we're going to talk
[00:01:05] about building a resilient mindset and and this is like the emphasis is on building here you want to do active work
[00:01:12] to make sure that you're getting a little bit better every day uh and then last but definitely not least I'm going
[00:01:18] to show you guys some soft skills that you can use uh to make sure that you're actually crushing the games and I think
[00:01:24] this is definitely the one that a lot of players are missing because it's very easy to miss pretty much everyone that I
[00:01:30] know that has climbed has climbed the stakes knows that this is like these
[00:01:36] these soft skills are are the most important maybe not the most important but well the bably the most important
[00:01:42] all right so why am I qualified to tell you guys how to do this well you can see
[00:01:47] for one I've played more than 5 million hands of micro Stakes I was a fied poker professional in 2018 I stagnated got a
[00:01:56] job got a number of jobs later went back to college got a degree in teaching and
[00:02:02] became a teacher I was really happy teaching back then and decided that I wanted to get a hobby decided on poker
[00:02:09] as I obviously had some experience playing cards and I really liked it and and the goal was to just keep teaching
[00:02:15] because I love teaching and and just play some pokon on the side as you can see in my graph that uh that that hobby
[00:02:21] got a little bit out of hand and and turned into a profession later on uh and
[00:02:26] now these days I'm playing 1K through 5K with a 6.3 per 100 renate over 1.5
[00:02:32] million hands or so um I'm also the founder of nachos poker a cfp with 4
[00:02:37] million in uh player profits and lastly I coached over 200 players by now
[00:02:44] ranging from low stakes micro Stakes private coaching students to uh some of
[00:02:50] the The Crushers you see at at 5K let's start with defining our goals and this
[00:02:57] is something that I always ask when I'm doing an interview for the cfp which granted I'm not not doing as much these
[00:03:04] days because I want to focus more on the technical side of the game I I've done
[00:03:10] maybe maybe a hundred of these interviews back in the day and this is one of the questions that always came up
[00:03:15] and the answers were always pretty similar uh it was always a variation of I want to get to high Stakes or I guess
[00:03:22] I if you put it more generic then I want to um be successful but then when you
[00:03:28] ask the player how how do you make sure that you get those get close to those
[00:03:34] goals you get like a variation of different answers and and most of them very quickly find a way to to very to
[00:03:42] steer very far away from the the actual goals that they uh that they want to reach so let me give you an example
[00:03:48] let's say the goal that you set for yourself is to reach onek at some point
[00:03:53] right like saido like that in poker uh you don't always have control over the outcomes so it doesn't really make sense
[00:04:01] to put a time limit on that but what you can do is you can break down the goal
[00:04:07] into smaller actionable steps that are aligning with the desired outcomes and
[00:04:14] for those actionable steps you can put a time limit on so in this case we are
[00:04:20] aiming to get to 1K and what do we need to do to get to 1K now you can
[00:04:25] immediately see that if you pick a very broad goal like that that you will very quickly have to break it down into
[00:04:32] smaller goals and those smaller goals you have to break down into actionable steps uh I want to get to 1K and one
[00:04:39] thing that I want that I need for that is I need a a solid study plan right so
[00:04:45] that's something that we're going to go over today in order to get the studies solid study plan I might want to invest
[00:04:52] in coaching I might want to watch content I might want to ask other players how they are studying other
[00:04:58] successful players and based on that I can build a comprehensive study plan that is going
[00:05:05] to basically be the foundation that is going to bring me from low staks to high staks and so we've had this very broad
[00:05:13] goal of I want to get to high staks we broke it down into one smaller going you
[00:05:18] obviously needs maybe five to 10 others as well and then we broke that one down
[00:05:24] into actionable steps so the way this would look like is You' have one page uh
[00:05:31] with goals and then those goals you break down in smaller and smaller pie pieces so that if you start tomorrow you
[00:05:40] actually have something that you can do you can just go through the list of things that you need to do and just pick
[00:05:45] one of those tasks I remember um doing this back in I think it was 2019
[00:05:52] actually 2018 so 6 years ago I started with doing something like this something
[00:05:58] that resembles this process process and the very first thing that I I did was on
[00:06:04] the technical side I I start started studying C Bing which is a pretty common
[00:06:09] starting place for a lot of low St players and I vividly remember having a
[00:06:15] poker folder where there were now a few Sims and a few notes and I thought to myself this is going to take a lot of
[00:06:21] time before I'm actually getting something out of this and I think this is the key point of making an action
[00:06:27] plan like this is you are able to monitor progress right you you can go
[00:06:33] from your list down and you can just check off boxes in a a game or in an
[00:06:39] environment where the outcome doesn't necessarily match the workload that you
[00:06:46] put into it it's very important to be able to track progress and be able to tell yourself when [ __ ] hits the van and
[00:06:52] it inevitably will that you are doing the right things and you're on the right track so we we'll we'll cover this in in
[00:07:00] like the mindset section of this video as well but that's the most important thing because you're going to go on 30
[00:07:06] 40 byy and down swings you might not even be winning in the beginning but it's very important that you're able to tell yourself hey I've got like a solid
[00:07:13] plan here I am executing that plan to the best of my abilities so even if I'm losing today it won't be for long
[00:07:20] because I know that I'm fully committed to this lastly you want to work on fostering persistence and resilience and
[00:07:27] we'll cover how to do that a little later in this this video when we talk about mindset so let's dive into the
[00:07:32] study routine you can see here that I broke down the formations and some of the notes by how often they occur this
[00:07:40] is one of the ways that I use to uh to quantify the importance of of studying a
[00:07:47] specific spot another one is I use database reviews where we have in our
[00:07:52] team we have a very extensive stat Checker that allows me to go through my
[00:07:58] own database as well as other databases in a in a lot of depth it contains the range composition of pio in in every
[00:08:06] note that you can think of and every step you can think of so you can very easily compare if there's some some leak
[00:08:13] somewhere we can very easily spot where the leak comes from is it because you're not betting enough Bluffs on earlier
[00:08:18] streets or is it because some other reason obviously if you're low player you might not necessarily have those
[00:08:24] tools you now have have this chart that that's going to be this first step
[00:08:30] assuming that you are low X player right now I would highly recommend you to start with the defending noes so you can
[00:08:36] see here the first one is three p in position P colar defend versus a b and it will be roughly 11% of the of the
[00:08:45] line volume in this in this chart this chart contains flop and turn lines
[00:08:50] doesn't contain any River lines and it contains bedding as well as polarization no so you can see the second line here
[00:08:56] is three bet pull out of position pre brazer bets and Barrel opportunity it's a pretty tough one to study because uh
[00:09:04] well for a number of reasons but you got to not just construct a betting line but you also got to construct a checking
[00:09:11] line and then a check raising versus different bed sizes so it's it's pretty complex notes whereas the defending ones
[00:09:17] are usually relatively simple and the models that you're going to be using let's say you're using GTO Wizard or Pio
[00:09:24] those are going to apply pretty pretty neatly to most situations obviously sometimes a player might be range
[00:09:31] betting instead of mixing and it might not work perfectly but the chances of a
[00:09:36] GT Model looking or resembling the situation that you're facing in game on
[00:09:42] the flop in a defending line is relatively relatively straightforward
[00:09:47] the chances are relatively high again set a specific and measurable goal break down the goal into actionable steps I'll
[00:09:54] show you part of the process uh that I use for this a little bit later the
[00:09:59] video but let's just go with three imposition Pro of quer Defending versus bam one way you could do this is you
[00:10:06] could say okay I'm I I want to get better at that right I could just
[00:10:11] Mindless uh drill mindlessly into a solver and if you I don't know drill a
[00:10:17] thousand hands then you're probably going to get better and and it will be an actionable step could refine it a little bit more but you will get better
[00:10:24] right now the thing that you probably want to do is you want to do something called deliberate practice where you
[00:10:30] take that that that goal of okay I want to get better at defending as three in
[00:10:35] position people of CER so as a Defender and three bat PS in position facing cats
[00:10:40] um and you want to make it a bit more targeted so in this case what we are saying is we are going to defend versus
[00:10:47] a cat let's say we are going to go with the small seats only because the bigger seats don't happen as often and are less
[00:10:54] important and if we have some sort of a baseline then we can always sort of
[00:11:00] manually derive information from that so let's say we Face a 1/3 cat and every pair and some a high are calling and now
[00:11:06] we Face a half and we're like okay well we we still call Our Best pairs like
[00:11:11] anything but our worst Pairs and and our best a high or something like that anyway so this is the process of
[00:11:17] deliberate practice it's not necessarily coined by Angela Duckworth but she WR
[00:11:24] has written a book called grits where I've gotten a lot of information very very valuable resource and I highly
[00:11:31] recommend anyone reading it anyway you want to choose a targeted skill so if you're running you might want to focus
[00:11:39] when you when you're training you want to focus on the first 20 M first 10 m r and and you want to refine that rather
[00:11:46] than just run an entire race consistently to get better as you want to pick a targeted skill in this case
[00:11:51] we're going to go with defending versus cats then you want to go for consistent feedback in in poker that's in one hand
[00:11:59] it's it's a little bit tough because you rarely have a coach with you consistently while you're while you're
[00:12:06] studying or training but you do have a solver that is going to be able to provide you with some feedback so a
[00:12:11] coach would be helpful but a solver will mostly have to have to make do then you
[00:12:16] want to go for what Angela do word call purposeful repetition meaning that you
[00:12:22] want to practice the situation with a level of intensity you want to make
[00:12:29] challenging for yourself so that you build intuition and resilience later you want to reflect after each session to
[00:12:35] identify improvements and adjust strategies so what is this in poker right so we just have chosen uh three
[00:12:44] imp be of caller so we'll go with that one rather than versus check prace works
[00:12:49] fine on both the first thing that you might be willing to do is you filter for all the hands where you folded versus a
[00:12:55] cat in the three port in your track room and review hands if you already made a mistake direct e mistakes make flash
[00:13:02] cards out of the upgrades so uh one way you can do this is just export them all and put them in GTO wizard analyzer and
[00:13:10] GTO wizard analyzer will literally tell you hey these ones were EV mistakes these ones were frequency mistakes and
[00:13:16] these ones were just fine what you can do is by doing that you can filter relatively quickly through the hands and
[00:13:22] see hey wait I've made um EV mistakes consistently on 10 high or lower boards
[00:13:29] so on low boards I make mistakes and that's probably because I'm missing something there and I can study those a little bit better uh to gain a better
[00:13:37] understanding of what it is that I'm missing those those things the things that you're missing you're going to put
[00:13:42] into flash cards so let's say you have folded a king queen on 10 six do rainbow
[00:13:48] and you now know that you should always defend your your two overcard type hands or mostly defend or your two of type
[00:13:54] hands um versus a small seat on on that texture that from then that is what your
[00:14:00] flash card will look like one is the situation and the other one is a simple to follow euristic then purposeful
[00:14:07] repetition drill a set of flash cards with upgrades aka the ones that you just made the ones with mistakes before each
[00:14:13] session that you play by doing this you you make use of something called habit stacking where you are going to play a
[00:14:20] session you know that you're going to be playing a session um because you like playing poker presumably and you use
[00:14:26] that as an anchor to to learn a new habit or to integrate a new habit which is drilling the flash cards with
[00:14:33] upgrades and if you do that both at the same time or like one obviously before the other then you you stack the habits
[00:14:42] and you make it more likely that you'll stick to integrating the the habit of drilling the flash cards after each
[00:14:48] session review how well you implemented your upgrades with real hands and adjust your flash cards based on new insights
[00:14:53] and recuring challenges in other words like it's just a continuous process of
[00:14:58] getting a little bit better every time and then adjusting flash cards adding new flash cards in because at some point
[00:15:05] you realize hey I need to I I I thought I could defend always with my two ards but this is this is an exception and
[00:15:12] there will be an insane amount of exceptions and the one that is best is
[00:15:17] the one that's best able to look at the data points in the hand and and realize
[00:15:23] what the what this situation warrants as a as a response from you as a as a poker
[00:15:28] player so you can see here I um basically made some sort of a to-do list with actionable steps in order to plug
[00:15:36] my league of over folding slightly versus check race and the funny thing is I used to over defend and then slowly
[00:15:43] but steadily I I started folding a little bit more a little bit more one on one hand because I I think the incentive
[00:15:49] for over defending is is no longer there so on the one hand it was like okay I I used to over defend and now I don't
[00:15:55] think that incentive other words like I don't think the pool the way the pool plays doesn't necessarily warrant me to
[00:16:02] want to over defend that much anymore so I wanted to go a bit more closer to GTO
[00:16:08] but then now I'm I'm over defending over folding sorry uh slightly it's not a big mistake it's like a slight overfall but
[00:16:15] I thought it it could you could be useful to um to basically make a list of actionable steps and just do them and um
[00:16:22] and then get a little bit better at this so that I'm not necessarily overfilling anymore or wherever I'm overfilling I'm
[00:16:29] doing it with uh with purpose and intent rather than just not knowing what the exact solution is all right so if you do
[00:16:35] this consistently if we go back to the goal setting here you go with the goal
[00:16:40] of I want to get to high stakes in order to get to high stakes I need to make sure that my technical skills are of
[00:16:46] high stakes level and then sub goal below that is I need to make sure that I'm defending well in all of the Flop
[00:16:54] defending notes subg go um defending well in two in position collar and and then make like a list of actionable
[00:17:01] steps where at the end you have let's say in the in in this formation you might have like 200 flash cards or
[00:17:07] something like that you do that for all the formations what has happened um if you just do the work you have become a
[00:17:14] better poker player right and that's the that's that's the overall goal you might now think like hey [ __ ] that's like a
[00:17:20] [ __ ] lot of work and the reality is that it is um the cool thing is that in this day and age there's a lot of free
[00:17:26] information available to any of you guys and so the one that's going to do best is the one that is going to be able to
[00:17:33] one um integrate that information into a into a structural to a structure that
[00:17:39] that makes sense basically you're able to look at this and and be able to like okay this these are the things that I
[00:17:45] think have value and I'm going to incorporate and these are the things that I don't think are as valuable and I'm going to disregard for now and and
[00:17:52] that's fine right and then the second thing and and probably the most overlooked thing is just doing the
[00:17:58] actual work is um is is very important it's important because you want to get
[00:18:03] you want to become a significantly better poker player but also whenever you are on a 40 by down swing you don't
[00:18:09] want to be the guy that gives up and it's very easy to give up if you subconsciously know that you're not doing everything within your power to
[00:18:15] become a better poker player let's go here U building a resilient mindset I want to show you guys this thing called
[00:18:22] the C influence it's this thing and basically what it is is it is a model
[00:18:29] that shows you uh things that are in your control in your influence or not
[00:18:36] neither in your control or your influence completely external so if we put some things in here that are poker
[00:18:44] related then um we can say that whether you are winning today is mostly external
[00:18:53] it's a little bit in your influence right if you decide to punt consistently and open can shove every every second
[00:19:00] hand then you are probably not going to win if you play very well then you
[00:19:05] increase your chances of winning significantly compared to like open shoing every hand but I think I'm
[00:19:10] winning between between 52 and 55% of my sessions somewhere in in that in that
[00:19:16] ballpark so the vast not the vast majority like the much more often than
[00:19:22] you think I I'm still losing my sessions which is kind of shitty but it it is the way the game works what is in your
[00:19:29] control is like whether you are studying today or not right that's something that's completely in your control or
[00:19:35] like mostly in your control obviously if you get a heart attack or something happens to someone in your family or
[00:19:41] whatever then you might really want to study you might have planned it but something out of your control happened
[00:19:46] and and now you're not studying but for the most part it's in your control and
[00:19:52] the reason why it's important to be aware of these things is because there's often times things happening
[00:19:59] that are completely outside of your control like you are losing at poker this day week month even year and even
[00:20:06] though you might be a winning player that that's still happening and it's easy to forget that there are still a lot of things that are happening within
[00:20:12] your control or within your influence that you could do to to change your situation I've become pretty good at
[00:20:18] this at using this model so let me give you an example someone in my in my in my
[00:20:24] inner circle has been dealing with with health issues like sign ific health issues and the the moment that we became
[00:20:30] aware of this person having health issues it was a very very big shock to
[00:20:36] me um this person is pretty young and and I we just never expected something
[00:20:42] um bad to this person's health to happen the moment that I heard it I was I was I was devastated I was like I can't do
[00:20:49] anything I felt powerless because like what can you do when someone's health is declining you want to heal them and and
[00:20:56] and make them better and and just like make them able to enjoy life but you're not right like the reality of the
[00:21:02] situation is that in the vast majority of cases when something happens to someone's Health you don't have any
[00:21:07] control or even influence on that situation I felt devastated and this
[00:21:12] person is very close to me so I I really really took a all on me when whenever I
[00:21:18] found out that this was happening and the first like the first thing that I thought was okay feeling a lot of stress
[00:21:24] that stress is is normal in this situation so accept it this is a stress ful situation you're allowed to feel
[00:21:30] stressed and it's the same thing in poker right you can copy paste the same process to like poker when obviously
[00:21:36] something happens that that at the moment is very shitty to you it might not be as shitty as like someone you
[00:21:41] love getting really sick or something like that but the initial response from your body is probably going to be high
[00:21:46] levels of stress feeling really shitty and and um not really seeing any
[00:21:51] positives in in in the situation that you're in being accepting that you are going through a tough time and you are
[00:21:59] therefore going to feel annoying not so fun feelings is is step one and then
[00:22:05] step two is like ask yourself okay what is in my control right now and what is
[00:22:11] not right so this person's health unfortunately I have very little control over I can't heal them I'm not a doctor
[00:22:18] I I can't do anything to make this person's situation significantly better right now but what I can do is I can
[00:22:25] make sure that my connection to this player to to to this this person is is getting much deeper and I can be as
[00:22:32] supportive as I can while this person is going through this uh phase so I don't
[00:22:37] have influence on this person's situation directly but indirectly I've
[00:22:43] actually I can provide a lot of uh support and I might not be able to heal them but I am able to make them feel
[00:22:51] significantly better or at least like a little bit less um less worse right like
[00:22:58] I can I can make that very shitty situation that this person is in Just a Touch better and that's definitely
[00:23:05] within my control so I started like sending regular texts like very easy
[00:23:10] right very easy step that is in my control that I can do to make the situation a little bit better and um and
[00:23:17] helping him out and like all these things that that that were in my control
[00:23:23] um I I did so something really bad happens you take some time to feel you take some time to reflect and then you
[00:23:29] ask yourself what is in my control and what is not and quite often you'll see that even in the worst of times there
[00:23:36] are things that you you can do to make the situation a little bit better it won't change the way you feel directly
[00:23:42] it might not even as significantly improve your situation in the short term but because you are focusing on
[00:23:48] something that that is within your control that is um making the situation
[00:23:54] better if you keep on doing that consistently for one you will make make your situation better and two you will
[00:24:01] feel better because you did something it's always better to do something than just lethar
[00:24:07] lethargically lay on bed with bag of Doritos and and just like feel sorry for
[00:24:13] yourself but quite often what ends up happening is that rather than this being a very consistent and in easy to follow
[00:24:20] model it is all sort of a mess and you don't know where to pick up pick up the pieces anymore and this model helps me
[00:24:26] quite often to like put everything in the right place okay so I have control over these things I have influence over
[00:24:33] these things and these things that are happening right now are completely outside of my control right so circle of
[00:24:39] control very very important model that I use then the other thing that I do is I
[00:24:45] build mindset flash cards and this is something that is um done in uh CBT
[00:24:50] quite often not necessarily through flash cards but the idea of like restructuring the way you think quite
[00:24:57] often the thing that we don't have control over like the things that happen to us and how they make us feel but what
[00:25:04] we do have control over the the things that we do and the things that we think and so whenever someone is for instance
[00:25:12] depressed or uh someone is in poker going through a rough batch you you can
[00:25:18] do you can you can actively try to think of things and I know that might sound a little bit not concrete abstract I guess
[00:25:26] um but you can you can make sure you structure your internal monologue in a way where it's helpful rather than
[00:25:33] detrimental so to give you an example like I used to suffer a lot from mistake tilt mistake tilt is when you make a
[00:25:40] mistake and you recognize a few seconds or even a minute later that it was a mistake for whatever reason and then you
[00:25:47] you start tilting so for instance I make a call on the river I actually this happened like recently it's it's usually
[00:25:54] a call in the river I I made a call in the river in a multi spot in in the live game was playing
[00:26:00] 102040 and I was in a multiway spot with an over pair ases on a low texture in a
[00:26:06] four b b three-way 200 Big LS deep I had ases on the low texture and I checked
[00:26:12] and both players put money into the PT and then by the time we got to the river
[00:26:17] there was one po siiz bed left and a guy went all in and I went into the tank and I realized okay if I'm folding here I'm
[00:26:23] folding my entire range because I Four B pre C Four B pre flop so I'm I only have overpress by the time I get here and to
[00:26:31] defend and this guy might still have some Bluffs and he jammed and I ended up
[00:26:36] calling this particular overpair because it was the best overpair to call and then I just decided to fold the rest um
[00:26:42] therefore over folding already a little bit but since it's such a unique situation where you're called for betting and and your multiway I think if
[00:26:49] you if you think that your opponent is under bluffing you should just fold your bluff catchers then don't beat any value
[00:26:55] in this case that was the case so in other words I long story short I should have fold it I realized that like 2
[00:27:00] minutes after the hand and I was I was slightly tilted I this was this would be something that would would like Spiral
[00:27:07] into a complete complete monkey tilt like a few years ago but now right now I'm I'm better able to call myself I
[00:27:13] guess in in a in a way so the way it used to happen it used to go is I would
[00:27:19] face a river bed I would click call and then I would realized that it was a mistake either because I saw the hand
[00:27:25] that my opponent showed or there was something else like like did in like live hand where I realized hey this is a
[00:27:31] unique spot I don't need to do anything GTO is I just need to go with like do I
[00:27:36] beat Bluffs and if I don't I can just sorry do I beat value here and if I don't then I can just fold all my bluff
[00:27:44] catchers that don't beat value in a spot that I think is severely under bluffed because of the uniqueness of the spot
[00:27:50] you have some sort of upgrade that you later realized but because there's a time bank at the moment you you miss it that happens so does the trigger you
[00:27:57] feel an emotion when that happens so in this case I saw his hand I realized obviously he has it there like he always
[00:28:03] has a set or in this case he had straight go with a very negative internal monolog so the negative
[00:28:09] internal monologue that they used to have would be something like oh my God this is so stupid obviously he has it um
[00:28:15] I should have fo it if I keep on doing this I'll never become a winning player you can immediately see how that trigger
[00:28:22] and then a negative thought pattern can sple into a feeling of Despair where
[00:28:27] you're like okay well there's one thing that goes wrong and your mind makes it so that you you will never become a
[00:28:35] winning poker player I was the winning poker player at the time this was around the time when I started my blog on run at once um and and so that's like
[00:28:42] obviously a very um very detrimental mindset to have now you can change
[00:28:47] making the mistake and you can lower the frequency obviously but you will still make mistake make mistakes poker is a
[00:28:54] game of mistakes and the one that makes least mistakes wins most but 100% even
[00:29:01] the best players in the world are going to make consistent mistakes every session that they play so you can't
[00:29:06] change that you can't necessarily change the way making the mistake feels to you
[00:29:12] but you can change your thought pent so in this case what I said to myself after making the mistake in the in the recent live game is okay you've made a mistake
[00:29:20] we are going to take a few deep breaths it's going to feel a bit stingy right now but that's fine and um tonight
[00:29:28] whenever you're analyzing the session you're just going to review it and try to learn as much as you can from the situation um and and what I learned from
[00:29:34] it is I need to go over my process and uh of of bluff catching and go with a
[00:29:40] very simple process that I outlined in our cfp content and that I usually use in these situations just not in this
[00:29:47] time but I need to reintegrate that so I need to be very strict with myself and do that right but if you if you do it
[00:29:53] like that if you restructure that very negative thought into something bit more positive where there's actional steps in
[00:30:00] there then quite easy quite quickly what you'll see is that initial Spike of emotion will quickly dissolve and and
[00:30:08] the way to do this is you want to do it in a way where it's almost as if you are coaching someone else right because our
[00:30:14] inner monologue quite often is pretty harsh and not very friendly if you do it in a way where you are coaching someone
[00:30:21] else then you you would never say something like hey if you keep on doing this you'll never become winning poker player you you'd say something like hey
[00:30:27] man you mistake that's okay um everyone makes mistakes uh just try to learn as much as you can from it after the
[00:30:33] session and just focus on the decisions that are left at hand right now right boom fixed and the thing that you want
[00:30:39] to do now is you want the mindset upgrades like that they can be plenty more it could you could find them in
[00:30:46] books you can find them in mindset videos you can find them everywhere in life even just reflecting on things and
[00:30:52] then what you want to do is you want to write down those upgrades and you want to Dr them consistently same thing as
[00:31:00] with the technical upgrades you just go with the Habit tagging um and before you play a session you are going to do a
[00:31:08] bunch of these flash cards I've I've picked two here I have a deck of flash basically I used to have like physical
[00:31:14] flash cards then I used something called brainscape which is a flash card program and now I use anky of I have them spread
[00:31:20] around everywhere and I don't use them as often as I should these days mostly because I feel like my my mindset is
[00:31:26] already pretty good but they look something like this question on one side of the flash card would be what have I
[00:31:32] learned about journey and destination and the other side of the flash card says U that life is neither about the
[00:31:38] journey nor the destination it's about who you become on the journey and that
[00:31:43] was something that I heard I can't remember who who said it but something that that really helped me in and like
[00:31:49] that's like a model that that I think is beneficial to me because it's very easy to focus on like I want to get to 1K and
[00:31:55] and what you often hear is like no be it's it's about the the journey right
[00:32:01] it's not about destination it's about the journey and this tells me it's actually about who I become on my way
[00:32:07] there right so it's not necessarily about the things that I'm going to experience it's not about the
[00:32:12] destination it's about who I become and again that is something that I have control over so even if I don't reach my
[00:32:19] destination even if the experience was shitty then still I am going to become a significantly better poker player today
[00:32:27] like at that point that I am today this is a a simple one one that I just like I heard this somewhere I made or read this
[00:32:33] somewhere made a note of it I thought this is something that I want to remind myself of obviously it could be
[00:32:39] something like this it could be something like the restructuring your negative thoughts in a more positive way
[00:32:47] uh could be all sorts of stuff right and yeah like again use the flash cards make use of um of space repetition and habit
[00:32:54] stacking space repetition is where you do something five minutes every day and it will have a bigger impact 35 minutes
[00:33:01] in one instance in a week all right so next one is find your tribe definitely
[00:33:06] the thing that was pivotal in my own poker experience is like my my journey
[00:33:12] through the stakes is becoming a member of Poker detox they have helped me tremendously like I wouldn't be playing
[00:33:19] the Stak that I am today or be in the position that I am today if I hadn't found poker detox I found like a a
[00:33:26] smaller group of players within poker detox that I exchanged ideas with and and and so much and so
[00:33:33] forth I should say but yeah like finding fighting your tribe is really important because one thing that people often
[00:33:40] think and this is like the biggest flaw in in poker study is poker is a single
[00:33:45] player game and therefore I need to make sure that I get as much information out
[00:33:52] of someone else without giving anything in return that would basically increase my chances as much as possible
[00:33:59] um and my opponent's chances are not going to get increased and therefore I'm I'm winning right that's like the thing
[00:34:05] like you have this piece of information and your word if I tell this Bild group of guys or whatever then I'm I am I by
[00:34:13] definition going to win less because they are going to have an ADV an informational advantage over me in
[00:34:20] reality poker is a multiplayer zero some game what I mean by that is we are all playing in a pool let's say you have the
[00:34:27] bitb guy and they're all sharing information right bitb being one of the if not the the best CFB out there and
[00:34:34] definitely produced some of the highest takes players uh in the game guys like make boy Finn George Cameron like just
[00:34:42] just like topnotch topn guys let's say you have those guys right and and they would approach the game like okay I'm
[00:34:47] not going to share information with anyone there would probably not be nowhere close to where they are right now the reason in part why they are
[00:34:55] doing so well is because they chose to share information with others even though they might not necessarily get
[00:35:01] something in return right away and that might make the other players in the group better at that point and you at
[00:35:07] that point stay at exactly the same skill level although like they might bring some counters to your ideas or
[00:35:14] concepts and might sharpen it up a little bit but in a grand scheme of things they might become slightly better
[00:35:19] you stay the same but because you do it in a multiplayer Zero Sum game you as a
[00:35:25] group if you do that consistently in every sort of does that then you as a group as a smaller group within this
[00:35:31] like larger pool become significantly better same thing happens in R cfp obviously as well this is something that
[00:35:38] I uh I took to heart and like whenever I was in detox I remember building some
[00:35:43] sort of a tool that would easily um let you easily browse their methodology because it was like 400 Pages or
[00:35:49] something like that and and and you wanted to find a way to like get to the key points relatively quickly whenever
[00:35:55] you're studying whatever so I built that and I shared it within the team I shared
[00:36:00] a bunch of other things whenever I did that I obviously like got some thank yous and like hey that's nice but
[00:36:05] nothing immediately in return but later on I got a lot of tools that were not on
[00:36:11] the market that no one in detox had simply because I was someone because they knew I was someone
[00:36:18] that was willing to share information and and therefore they were more where way they were more willing to share
[00:36:23] information with me that is the key if you are able and are willing to share the things that you know people are able
[00:36:30] and willing to share the things that they know and then you two or your smaller group might get collectively
[00:36:36] significantly better than the rest of the pool all right so we have a smallish tightly knit nachos pooker
[00:36:43] public Discord where I'm hanging out quite often and there's like an ask me anything Channel and and all sorts of
[00:36:48] stuff I highly recommend you joining it and just um getting a feel for what our
[00:36:54] community looks like um as well as like finding your tribe um hopefully um and maybe you find some guys within the
[00:37:00] community that you want to study with or whatever um we try to do regular sessions where we do some hand reviews
[00:37:08] or um some other content like this that we present to for free to our Discord
[00:37:13] members um last couple of months has been a bit silent as I've been traveling but yeah I definitely join and hope to
[00:37:19] see you guys there and then lastly um I I got this message from one of our
[00:37:25] players and I think this is not going to read out the entire message but basically the I I'll make a video of
[00:37:31] this but basically the message is how do how do I make most of this opportunity
[00:37:36] in the cfp that's like the core of the message and then a couple of sub questions I think this is really smart
[00:37:42] because like I don't get these messages very often right sometimes I get them but not not consistently and I think the
[00:37:49] reason is because there is like U um people are a little bit hesitant to ask
[00:37:55] for something without giving anything in return immediately um it's a little bit scary like someone might say [ __ ] off or um or just simply
[00:38:02] no the reality is that asking for help is free um and if you do that if you do
[00:38:08] stuff like this consistently you might get information you otherwise wouldn't wouldn't be able to have right and in
[00:38:16] poker which is a war of information like that little bit of information might help you and set you on the right path
[00:38:22] to becoming a low questioner in other words like asking for information or asking for opinion is always free and I
[00:38:29] think anyone should do that as often as possible not necessarily to be argumentative with the person or
[00:38:34] whatever just like try to absorb information you might not use it this time it might not be valuable at this
[00:38:39] moment but at some point it might be right and someone might give you information that is U that is pivotal
[00:38:45] for your for your own poker career um then I have some thoughts on coaching that I wanted to share so and and and
[00:38:51] like specifically cfps I guess and not not necessarily to plug my own although like you're happy to apply obviously
[00:38:58] but like there are some some pros and cons um let's start let's start with the
[00:39:03] CFB so the obvious Pro is that you get access to to our entire methodology
[00:39:10] where we as a team and I want to stress this like there's a team working on strategy we worked hundreds of hours to
[00:39:18] to find information that you'd otherwise have to find yourself so for instance like the flash cards for three inition
[00:39:23] CER those are going to be in there and for all the other defending notes as well so you don't have to actually go through the painful process of just
[00:39:31] drilling a thousand uh hours to get the information that you want we've already
[00:39:36] done that for you with a team of of high stch pooker players so that you you just
[00:39:42] need to study basically this is basically the goal usually you want to have a you join the cfp so that the you
[00:39:48] Outsource a lot of the manual labor that you need to do for doing data work or
[00:39:54] even GTO work preparing Souls whatever um finding the information that you need
[00:40:00] the costs are relatively high but you pay at the end um so I was in poker detox I paid a significant amount to
[00:40:06] them like I would be without a heartbeat I would be doing it again obviously there's going to be players with different opinions and that's fine as
[00:40:12] well it's a relatively straightforward route and um I think most of the players at high stakes right now got there
[00:40:19] through some form of coaching and quite likely a cfp simply because it's such an effective way to get to higher Stakes if
[00:40:26] you're already winning at 7bb at 25 an hour or something like that then I wouldn't wouldn't necessarily recommend
[00:40:32] you thinking about it although when I joined poker deto I was winning at at roughly that win rate so if you're
[00:40:37] already winning significantly maybe maybe just like going for some private coaching or no coaching at all might be
[00:40:42] the way to go but definitely if you're struggling a bit more um and you're looking some for some more support
[00:40:48] looking for a community then then that's definitely the way to go um I've got a few private coaching students as well uh
[00:40:55] that are just paying for hourly coaching and that can be very effective it's you don't get the same content like the same
[00:41:01] structure usually that you get um so it's it's less of a entire program and more of a um mentorship type thing but
[00:41:10] definitely very very useful for some players costs are relatively High
[00:41:15] generally at The Upfront costs compared to like where you might be right now so quite often it's the question of do you
[00:41:22] want to invest either a big Port portion of your bankroll or some outside money to acquire skills that is that are going
[00:41:28] to increase your hourly or your bb per 100 and so that it will pay off over
[00:41:34] time and so there's more of an investment in that but I've gotten both private coaching and cfp coaching and
[00:41:40] very rarely I have been disappointed with the results that I've gotten and
[00:41:46] and the reason for this is that I do very thorough research on my coaches on the guys that I that I get coaching from
[00:41:52] because I want to make sure that the experience that I'm getting is not based on someone that is doing very like what
[00:42:00] you don't want is you want don't want to get coaching from the best marketing guy right and we started our cfp with zero
[00:42:07] marketing this is like basically the first marketing that we do is like these videos and and even these videos I'm doing because I like making content and
[00:42:14] I like providing information to players but I don't necessarily like like make some sort of a newsletter that is going
[00:42:20] to funny you into whatever I don't don't really like that so we don't do it anyway like you want to make sure that
[00:42:26] you get someone that is has ACT actual results and can give some references of
[00:42:32] recent students that he had that that are going to be um um yeah that that
[00:42:37] help you make the decision to get him as a coach or her but usually him and then
[00:42:43] last few notes taking initiative tends to get rewarded like basically the thing
[00:42:48] that um turkey bed here did usually pays out and then and then the thing that you
[00:42:54] also want to do is come prepared quite often I get into private coaching sessions with with students in the cfp
[00:43:00] and there's an entire framework of like okay this is how you book a call this is how you prepare for a call etc etc etc
[00:43:07] and then we start a session and I ask okay what what is it that you want to get out of the session and that they have no idea and um we're still going to
[00:43:14] do the session it's just going to be less productive you're not going to get as much information out of the session
[00:43:20] as you otherwise would have and the guys that are doing best in the cfp are always going to be the guys that come um
[00:43:25] very well prepared so for instance we have give you an example of a recent one we have a guy in a cfp that has moved up
[00:43:32] from 25 and all2 he's not taking shorts at 1,000 and all and in a recent session that I did with him he um he said okay
[00:43:41] we have these simplified GTO protocols where we basically uh it's hard to
[00:43:47] explain but basically if you are in a specific note you can follow the the
[00:43:52] protocol like bet this hand class this often this hand class this often often um and you will capture the vast
[00:43:59] majority of the EV in that spot so it's basically GTO but simplified you'll be making some mistakes on some textures
[00:44:06] but on the vast majority of textures you're not going to make any massive EV mistakes if you play us uh that
[00:44:11] simplified form of GTR and what he did was he said okay I've got this simplified version of GTO I drilled a
[00:44:17] thousand hands and now I want us to go over the mistakes that I made according to the solw worm and I want to ask you
[00:44:25] um I whether it's relevant like the whether the mistake is relevant and if it's not relevant and if it's relevant
[00:44:31] then how can I um make sure that I don't keep making these mistakes so what is the upgrade that I can take away from
[00:44:36] this as a very very well prepared and well structured with a very clear
[00:44:42] objective both sear call with a very clear objective and and and it went well and um yeah like obviously he he um he
[00:44:49] learned a lot like when you do something like that you are going to get what you want out of it if you just are like well
[00:44:56] not entirely sure let's let's look at last night's hands then you're going to learn significantly less so come
[00:45:02] prepared is the last piece of advice that I want to give you guys so that's it for this video if you guys have any
[00:45:07] questions comments whatever drop them down in the comments below join our public Discord and if you're kind enough
[00:45:13] feel free to leave a like and talk to you guys soon bye
