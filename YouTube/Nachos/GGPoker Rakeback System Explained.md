### Introduction & Context on High Stakes Tables

> "Hey guys, what's up, this is Nachos. In this video, I want to talk about the rakeback system on GG, and then in particular, I want to hone in on the profitability of the new 10/20 tables."

> "For those of you who missed it, GG got rid of the high tables—the 25/50 up to

> ```
> 
> 2k tables that were running 24/7 pretty much—they are now private. So no one can play except for the GG professionals that are playing occasionally on there; tables are not really running anymore."

> "Instead we've got this, which is the new 10/20 tables. You can see they're relatively popular. And so what I wanted to do is try and see if I could find any information, present any data to you guys on the profitability of those tables. For one, because I was interested in playing them myself, but on the other hand, like to share this with you guys because the rakeback system on GG is not transparent at all. The rake is very high, so it can be relatively tough to get an estimate on how much you're winning."

### Disclaimer: Bad Beat Jackpot & Sample Size

> "Before we dive in and before I show you guys the actual win rates, I want to acknowledge a few things here."

> "One of them is I did not take into account the Bad Beat Jackpot. The jackpot fees are taken out of the win rate, but hitting the Bad Beat Jackpot is not included in the win rates. Because it's, for one, near impossible to calculate what it would mean to [your] win rate. You just need an infinite amount of sample, and even then, it's pretty much impossible to make a reasonable estimation."

> "And second is, if you're playing not a very high volume—if you're not playing a lot of volume on GG—then you are not going to be winning them very often. You might get lucky and win one, but you might also go one year or two years without winning one if you just play a few thousand hands a year on the side. So I didn't take that into consideration, but keep in mind you're getting something back in return for those jackpot fees presumably."

### Understanding PVI (Player Value Index)

> "Next thing is the PVI, which is the method they use to calculate the rakeback. It varies on a lot of factors, and so it can be very tough to give you a good estimate of what rakeback is."

> "The way it works is they have this 'Fish' system where they advertise with—I think it's like up to 50 or 60% rakeback—but in reality, you get significantly less if you play consistent volume. If you're a winner, it can get as low as 12%. I know some winners on the side have more like 15 to 20%. It can vary based on the different factors, and it's really hard to understand why some guy gets less and the other guy gets more."

> "For instance, in my country in the Netherlands, the PVI is lowered to pay for the gambling tax that the operator has to pay. So it will vary from country to country, from player to player, and it's relatively tough to calculate."

### Data Methodology

> "Something to keep in mind: the rakeback system is not transparent as we mentioned before. It's just really tough to assess how much you're making."

> "The only way I was able to do it is: for one, ask a couple of players in my CFP (Coaching for Profits) to give me an estimate of how they were doing, and then just by having a spreadsheet and logging everything myself for some time."

> "The data we used for win rates in this video are based on the top 100 volume players. Those players are not going to have the highest win rate necessarily, and the reason is they are sometimes grinding leaderboards, which means that they're playing on non-profitable seats."

> "Like if we take the lobby here real quick, then there's going to be plenty of seats on here that aren't really profitable. Like on this table for instance, I don't think anyone is winning pre-rakeback is the reality of the situation. There's one presumably recreational—I'm not sure how bad he is—and then there's a bunch of Regs. Especially these two seats are not profitable. And that will happen with a bunch of these tables; they're just not going to be profitable enough to overcome the insane rake that you have to play on these tables."

### The Rake Structure Analysis

> "Let's start with the rake here. I pulled the rake for myself when I was playing NL200, NL500, NL1K, and NL2K. Especially for 200 and 500, I'm not entirely sure if it's very accurate because I haven't been playing that consistently for years... but I think roughly this is what it should be."

> "For NL1K, I got slightly under 8 BB [per 100 hands], and for NL2K, I got slightly under 7 BB, which seems to be pretty consistent with some of the other Regs that I spoke to."

> "To give you an idea: on other sites where I played 10/20, the rake that I paid there is a little over 1 BB—it's a little under 1.2, I think 1.18. Here on GG, over a small sample, I was paying 6.9 BB, which is like five times higher. A little over five times, which is just insane if you ask me."

> "And at NL1K on other sites, you pay around 2 Big Blinds, maybe a little bit more, but on most sites, you're not paying more than 2.5 Big Blinds. And on GG, you're paying eight."

### Rakeback Estimation

> "Having said that, there is rakeback, right? You're getting a reasonable amount of this back. How much you're getting back depends on a lot of factors. It depends on how much volume you're playing, in my case which country you're from, do you make it into the leaderboards, how high do you make it into the leaderboards?"

> "It literally matters quite a bit if you just play two days of 15 hours versus 4 days of eight (or seven and a half). And then it matters: do you have the affiliate rakeback? Which in the Netherlands you can't have, but some other countries you can basically register via an affiliate and then you get the affiliate part of the fee via the affiliate."

> "So you can see the total rakeback can vary from like 28% to 50%. In most cases, if you're making it into the leaderboard somewhat consistently, you're getting around 30% to 35% rakeback without the Bad Beat Jackpots. Obviously, Bad Beat Jackpot could add... it's hard to estimate how much that adds, I'm guessing another 10% maybe? Somewhere along those lines, but it could be more, it could be less. I have literally no idea because the standard deviation is insane. You need a lot of volume for that to converge."

> "The way I'm doing it for myself is I'm calculating with 30% rakeback. If you add some of the affiliate rakeback, maybe you can go with 35% flat rakeback. That's what you're getting. It's nice if you win a Bad Beat Jackpot... if you play a million hands a year then you can probably factor it in to some degree."

### Win Rate Analysis (The "Regs")

> "So let's look at the win rates. These are the win rates that I got from looking at the top 100 Regs and then excluding the clear fish. So these are Regs... roughly 97 Regs and 3 recreationals in them."

> "One thing to note is that the win rate for the NL2000 Regs is based on 850k hands. So even over a pretty large sample like that, the win rate could be significantly higher or significantly lower. It could be that the NL200 win rate is actually closer to the other three, which I highly doubt because of the high rake, but it implies that that's an option."

> "But for now, over 850k hands that the top 100 Regs have played combined (or at least the ones that are logged), it's **minus 1.78 Big Blinds per 100**, which is not great. But yeah, something we can overcome if the rakeback is high enough."

### The GG Structure: Winning via Rakeback

> "The point is though that the way GG designed its winnings for players is very smart. Because what they did is they made it so... for the average regular, the win rate is going to be higher on NL200 than it is on NL2000 simply because the rake is higher on NL200 and you're getting a percentage of that back."

> "This is sort of the same on other sites to some extent... problem here is that you start with negative win rates. So the part of your winnings that is rakeback is now actually more than 100% [of your profit], whereas otherwise, it's just part of your winnings."

> "Having said that, the data that we have in the CFP for players that are playing other sites is that their win rates stay more or less stable. The more they move up, the better they become obviously, and so the skill level increases, the rake decreases, the amount of recreationals decreases... and more or less you can say that an NL200 player is making on average a couple of Big Blinds per 100. Anywhere from let's say 3 to 7."

> "If that player is playing on Ignition and he makes 7 Big Blinds per 100, then he's going to be making roughly 7 Big Blinds per 100 on NL1K or NL2K as well. NL2K is actually the only different stake where we have slightly lower win rates as a CFP. The rest of the stakes are pretty much stable."

> "On GG, that's going to be different, right? Simply because of you winning a percentage of your rake, and that is going to be more than 100% of your winnings."

### Net Win Rates & Predatory Lobbies

> "This is the net win rate... The way we did it is we said, okay well the average Reg is going to get 35% rakeback pre-Bad Beat Jackpot. So that's where we're going with 35% rakeback; seems like a reasonable number to take. It's probably generous towards GG because I'm guessing that the average rakeback that they're paying is significantly less because not everyone makes it into leaderboards."

> "So, 35% of that rake minus the negative average win rate by the Regs... and then you get these win rates. **So for 10/20, you can see it is 0.67 Big Blinds per 100 post-rake and rakeback (not including the Bad Beat Jackpot).** And this is obviously very low."

> "Now realistically, you are able to get higher win rates pre-rakeback if you're table selecting consistently. That is definitely an option and it's a strategy a lot of players are using."

> "If I open a random table right now... you can see how quickly a table fills up. And you can see—which is kind of annoying in my opinion—is like if I take this seat, you'll see that the other seats get reserved relatively quickly. And sometimes just every seat gets reserved and you don't know if there's a recreational sitting down. It's just a matter of very predatory behavior from a lot of the Regs. There's basically nothing you can do about it, kind of annoying, but that's the way it works."

> "If you are a little bit less predatory... but still somewhat mindful of the table that you're playing... then your win rate can get a decent bit higher. It might be tougher to get into the leaderboards, you might be needing to play more hours... because if you don't make it into leaderboards then you run into the issue of missing the 7 to 18% rakeback, which obviously comes at a cost as well."

### Variance Simulations

> "Just before we end this video real quick, I wanted to show you what it means to win 0.63 BB per 100. This is at 100k hands: you can see results hovering between minus 60 buy-ins and plus 60 buy-ins. Like, no one knows anything after 100k hands at this win rate."

> "And again, this is the average win rate from the top 100 Regs. So they're like pretty decent players; some of the best players in the world are in this sample. Guys like Kevin Paqué, Cameron Couch is in there, George from BitB is in there... there's a bunch of high-volume crushers in there, obviously some weaker Regs as well."

> "Average win rate 0.63 [BB/100]. After 100k hands, you know [expletive] all unless you won like a jackpot obviously. After 500k hands, you still don't know anything. Like there's still a lot of noise in this. And a bunch of players are still losing after 500k hands. Imagine playing 500k hands—you're actually a winning player... but you're down 50 buy-ins or something like that over 500k? You're just going to assume that you're not winning. And this is including rakeback, right?"

> "Things like this happen much more often if you have a very low win rate. Where if you're playing on another site... you just might not be able to play a lot of volume on 10/20."

> "Yeah, you can see still a lot of players losing [after a] million hands. Pretty much same thing, right? Still some players losing. Obviously some more are winning right now, but the EV here is 60 buy-ins profit after a million hands. So it's a drop in a bucket basically."

> "And then the last one that I did is 5 million hands. And you can see still like it's pretty much everywhere. There are still players losing. Like this guy, 'Worst of 20' [simulation], is losing almost 200 buy-ins after rakeback. And poor guy has been down almost 400 buy-ins... under 800k down at some point."

> "You are actually a winning player, [but] win rates are just so extremely low that it's almost hard to assess whether you are winning or not. Which is why I find playing on GG... yeah it's probably something that I'm not really going to do, although I really like the idea of playing versus some of the guys that are playing there."

### Conclusion

> "My actual win rate over a few thousand hands is half a Big Blind over a reasonable sample pre-rakeback. So I'm getting some rakeback on top of that. I might be able to do a little bit better especially if I table select a little bit harder... I might be able to do a little bit better. Probably what I'm going to do is just mix them in as a low volume... play one, two, maybe three tables and see how things are going. And especially at the 10/20 level, I think I want to be a bit more careful."
