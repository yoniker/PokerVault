Hand1:
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=86

Yolen opens as LJ with AcQh, facing a 3-bet by sb, he 4-bet: 
People tend to not call enough and not 5-bet enough, not a huge difference from theory but enough different that it's significant enouugh to us wanting to 4-bet more.
Flop came 8d4d2s sb checked, Yolen bet 5BB into 39BB pot, his opponent X/R to 17.3BB, Yolen folded - people don't X/R without having a diamond in their hand and it's quite an easy fold.

Hand 2:
 https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=217
Yolen 3-bet with 8h7h as SB vs BU, flop came KcQs9d, Yolen just checked the flop and folded to a 4BB bet by BU on a 22BB pot, he said that the holding block folds and are super bad (blocking 88/77/suited hearts hands like 7h6h/8h7h)


Hand 3: 
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=321

Yolen played BU vs CO, he 3-bet Ac5c CO calls. 
Flop came 5d3c7s X/B30/ snap call.

Turn Ts, villian snap checks, Yolen bet the pot (even though in theory it should be checked back often) for the following reasons:
1. Villian snap actions - doesn't look like a strong range
2. Villian can still call worse Ax (in particual Ax of spades)
3. Can make Villian fold worse hands by triple barrelling







Hand 4:
Yolen opens with 7c7d as BU, BB calls.
Flop comes Ts5s3d, BB donks B50, yolen calls.
Turn 5c X/X
River 4s,BB insta checks, yolen considered checking back, but went all-in instead (70BB on 10BB pot) saying that it's better as BB wouldn't check flush this fast and can have a T-x playing this way and will fold close to 100% of his range


Hand 5:

Yolen open AcTd as LJ,BB calls. Flop comes KsTs9s X/X Turn Th X/B75/C River 2c X/B75 BB raised R90, Yolen decided to shove all-in as a bluff, he said that he would prefer to have a K at this spot, but he doesn't have a lot of Kx in this line (he checked back flop)


Hand 6:

Yolen 3-bet AsKs as CO vs LJ, LJ called.
Flop came TdTh4h X/B30/ snap call. Turn 8d snap check/check back. River Jc, LJ snap checked, Yolen decided to shove (because villian snap-checked river) all in (28BB into 23BB pot) to make pocket pairs fold - with the snap check there's high fold equity.

Hand 7:

CO opens to 2BB, Yolen called as BB with Js9d.
Flop came 3s9c5c, X villian bet 1BB, yolen X/R to 6BB, CO called.
Turn 2h, Yolen bet B75, CO folded, Yolen said that he has a read, CO wouldn't bet 1BB strong hand like  QQ/KK/AA so he doesn't mind betting J9 for value as he has the best hand often(!)


Hand 8:
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=1369
LJ vs BB SRP with QcJd,
flop comes 4dTh9h, X/B75/R90 Yolen calls pot is 28BB
Turn 6s BB Bets 21.1BB into 28.1BB, Yolen called for the following reasons:
1.  Implied odds
2. On any heart, his opponent will fold river


Hand 9:
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=1537
Yolen 3-bet Jd7s as BB vs sb open, sb flatted.
Flop came 9sKdKh X/X turn Qc X Yolen bet 9BB into 18BB, sb called.
Riven Jc sb X, Yolen debated if to check back and take his SDV, but decided that there are many Qx in villian's range so decided to overbet river 52BB into 36BB pot.

Hand 10:
Yolen opens 8d8h from BU, sb 3-bet yolen called.
Flop comes AdQd5s sb bet B30, Yolen called.
Turn 6h X/X
River 6h X - Yolen turned his hand into a bluff, and overbet the pot (53BB into 35BB).
