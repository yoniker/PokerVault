Hand1:
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=86

Yolen opens as LJ with AcQh, facing a 3-bet by sb, he 4-bet: 
People tend to not call enough and not 5-bet enough, not a huge difference from theory but enough different that it's significant enouugh to us wanting to 4-bet more.
Flop came 8d4d2s sb checked, Yolen bet 5BB into 39BB pot, his opponent X/R to 17.3BB, Yolen folded - people don't X/R without having a diamond in their hand and it's quite an easy fold.

Hand 2:
 https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=217
Yolen 3-bet with 8h7h as SB vs BU, flop came KcQs9d, Yolen just checked the flop and folded to a 4BB bet by BU on a 22BB pot, he said that the holding block folds and are super bad (blocking 88/77/suited hearts hands like 7h6h/8h7h)


Hand 3: 
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=321

Yolen played BU vs CO, he 3-bet Ac5c CO calls. 
Flop came 5d3c7s X/B30/ snap call.

Turn Ts, villian snap checks, Yolen bet the pot (even though in theory it should be checked back often) for the following reasons:
1. Villian snap actions - doesn't look like a strong range
2. Villian can still call worse Ax (in particual Ax of spades)
3. Can make Villian fold worse hands by triple barrelling







Hand 4:
Yolen opens with 7c7d as BU, BB calls.
Flop comes Ts5s3d, BB donks B50, yolen calls.
Turn 5c X/X
River 4s,BB insta checks, yolen considered checking back, but went all-in instead (70BB on 10BB pot) saying that it's better as BB wouldn't check flush this fast and can have a T-x playing this way and will fold close to 100% of his range


Hand 5:

Yolen open AcTd as LJ,BB calls. Flop comes KsTs9s X/X Turn Th X/B75/C River 2c X/B75 BB raised R90, Yolen decided to shove all-in as a bluff, he said that he would prefer to have a K at this spot, but he doesn't have a lot of Kx in this line (he checked back flop)


Hand 6:
https://youtu.be/cVwe9v8Uf4k?t=1369
LJ vs BB SRP with QcJd,
flop comes 4dTh9h, X/B75/R90 Yolen calls pot is 28BB
Turn 6s BB Bets 21.1BB into 28.1BB, Yolen called for the following reasons:
1.  Implied odds
2. On any heart, his opponent will fold river
