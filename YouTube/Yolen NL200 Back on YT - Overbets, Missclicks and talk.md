Yolen played BU vs CO, he 3-bet Ac5c CO calls. 
Flop came 5d3c7s X/B30/ snap call.

Turn Ts, villian snap checks, Yolen bet the pot (even though in theory it should be checked back often) for the following reasons:
1. Villian snap actions - doesn't look like a strong range
2. Villian can still call worse Ax (in particual Ax of spades)
3. Can make Villian fold worse hands by triple barrelling


Hand 2:

LJ vs BB SRP with QcJd,
flop comes 4dTh9h, X/B75/R90 Yolen calls pot is 28BB
Turn 6s BB Bets 21.1BB into 28.1BB, Yolen called for the following reasons:
1.  Implied odds
2. On any heart, his opponent will fold river
