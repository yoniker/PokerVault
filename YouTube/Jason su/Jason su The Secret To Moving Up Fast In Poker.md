Many people, when moving up from their usual game either:
1. Bluff more, hero call more etc
2. Do the opposite- freeze
This gap between how I usually play, what got me that shot in the first place, and how I play the higher stake is the reason why many people fail when moving up.

People who don't know what they're talking about say something like "Don't think about it. Don't think how you're playing against better players, pretend like you don't know who you're playing against" or "Detach from the money, it's just cards and chips until you cash out,reorient your thoughts". But I can't make myself believe something that is not true! Or they will say "Just play your game" :D :D :D It's like telling a basketball player, just win.

OK so how do I solve it?
The problem is not having those thoughts of being way more aggressive/passive.
It's the big emotions that come naturally as I move up the stakes that create those thoughts from an un-present state. I need to be present with those feelings and emotions. I need to feel them, acknowledge them. Feel those feelings to be me again, and not some other version of me who put those feelings and emotions and thoughts aside.
