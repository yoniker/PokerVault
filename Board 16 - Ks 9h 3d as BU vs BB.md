## Turn


## River



Flop X/B30/C, Turn Jh X/X, River Qc, X, BU bets sometimes with Ax (it has no SDV on this board), and with 8x that has no SDV. Notice that it makes sense as 9x has a little of SDV and so will not be used as a bluff, while 87/86 has no SDV (other 8x do) so that's why we pick those (other than the Ax) as a bluff
