## Flop

Global frequency is high (66%),Any two cards can bet on the flop, third pairs bet the least

## Turn

After flop went X/B30/C, on a 3d turn, BU continues betting with A-x offsuit if he has no SDV and the A is Ad (blocking BB's nut flushdraws)

## River

After flop went X/B30/C,  3d x/x, blank river(5c), BU doesn't bluff A-x (even the smaller ones), as a bet here targets the A-highs of BB which we block. A9 has to bet for value though.

Flop X/B30/C, Turn Jh X/X, River Qc, X, BU bets sometimes with Ax (it has no SDV on this board), and with 8x that has no SDV. Notice that it makes sense as 9x has a little of SDV and so will not be used as a bluff, while 87/86 has no SDV (other 8x do) so that's why we pick those (other than the Ax) as a bluff
