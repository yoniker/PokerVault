Flop goes X/X, turn Qd X/B75/C, on the river of Ad  I bluff only Jx or Kx for a big sizing B125 (and Qx goes for value)

Flop goes X/B30/C turn Td X/X river 2d and BB goes B120, BU calls almost pure with any Q (Q9o infrequently fold)

Flop goes X/X, turn 4c X/B75/C river 8d BB checks, BU bets any K/J with no SDV (but even K2 or AJ check back despite having just a little SDV)
