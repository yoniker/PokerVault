Board 3 - 9s8s5h

## Flop

## Turn



## River

 Turn Th8h, action checked through to the river and BB leads for half pot - 77 with a heart hand sometimes raises(!) and low frequency call and low frequency fold (25/25/50 fold call raise respectively). 77 with no heart is a pure fold. A5/A9/AT are pure calls. 8x with a heart raise more than without a heart 

Flop X/X turn 7d BB 1.1BB you raise he calls. River Qs BB x any JT is good enough for an overbet (even with no spade). Hands that bluff here most often are AJo/KJo/KTo with a spade (all as an overbet)/ATo with a spade
