## Flop

BU's global betting frequency after BB checks is 65%, ATC can bet, the hands that bet the most are AT+/AA/QQ (all close to pure),hands that bet infrequently are weaker Ax (A8-) and middling pocket pairs like JJ-44.

## Turn

Flop went X/X Turn 8c BB leads B115, BU is indifferent with KJ/KT and weak Ax just because the BB is supposed to take hands like 32s/64s/JTo/KTo and bluff those a lot for this sizing. If BB checks this turn, then low Ax bet infrequently



## River

Flop went X/B30/C Turn 9h X/X river 2d X/? BU overbets here pure AT+ but checks back pure weaker Ax.
