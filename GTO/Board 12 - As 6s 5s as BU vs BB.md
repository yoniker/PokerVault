## Flop

After BB checks flop BU's flop betting strategy is:
Global frequency: bets only 35% of the time.
Flushes(including nut flushes),sets,Kspades-x offsuite (nut flush draw) bet only sometimes.
Pure air bet sometimes as well, offsuite spades like JhTs bet sometimes,
Top pair bet infrequently- the better the kicker the more frequent BU bets it though (AK is betting frequently, AQ sometimes). Flush draws bet infrequently, and the nut flush draw (Ks-x) bet sometimes.

When BB donks B30, BU only calls and never raises (ANY pair, any spade, gutshots and infrequently even hands as weak as JcTc)




## Turn

After flop goes X/B30/C turn 9s, BB X,BU checks back pure with Ts like JhTs.

Flop X/X Turn Ac, Here's the strategy with pocket pairs: KK/QQ never net it with or without a spade, 88/99/TT bet it pure with a spade (JJ infrequently with a spade).

## River

Flop X/X Turn 5d X/X river 3c BB B55, BU actually take hands like Kd3d and turns them into a bluff on this spot, in general the strategy is AJo is good enough to raise for value (infrequently when holding a spade), AK/AQ raise more frequently (pure with a spade, sometimes without), flushes, 5x and 33 all raise for value and K3/Q3 are the main bluffs, weaker Ax pure call.
