## River

Flop X/X Turn 5d X/X river 3c BB B55, BU actually take hands like Kd3d and turns them into a bluff on this spot, in general the strategy is AJo is good enough to raise for value (infrequently when holding a spade), AK/AQ raise more frequently (pure with a spade, sometimes without), flushes, 5x and 33 all raise for value and K3/Q3 are the main bluffs, weaker Ax pure call.
