## Flop

Flop goes X/B50, BB continues with any pair, backdoor nut flushes, OESD, any gutshot, folds 22/33, continues pure with two overs with bd flush like KsJs


## Turn

flop X/X turn As, BB's leading strategy is polorized (2x pot), leading with A7/A9/sets and flush draws which don't have any SDV (like K2ss) bet more often than ones with SDV (for example Ks7s always checks back), pure folding bd flush with only one overcard like K3cc, indifferent with KQo/AJo

flop X/X, Turn 6h, KhTd/QhTs lead pure here as BB - they block BU's continue range (Kxhh/Qxhh) have two overcards as well as a gutshot.
