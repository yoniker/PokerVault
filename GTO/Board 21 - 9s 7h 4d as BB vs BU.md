## Flop
after BB X, BU's strategy is: 56% of his range bet. sets,two pair and vulnerable hands like 9x 7x TT/JJ bet pure, underpairs bet infrequently.

## Turn

Flop X/X turn Ts BB leads B115, Bu's strategy is:
1. Call any Tx
2. 9X region- it's indifferent with A9/K9/Q9, other 9X are pure continue as they have huge improvability (J9 is a gutshot, T9 two pair, 89 is pair+oesd)
3. With the 7x region, it prefer hands that can improve or have more SDV-so thinking about it A7/K7 are the worst (infrequently calling)
4. 66 call more than A7/K7 as it's a gutshot and a pair
5. Flushdraw it calls, combo draws it raises infrequently

## River

Flop goes X/B30/C Turn Td X/X river 6s. Air hands bet sometimes, Tx and better always bet, a strong 9x always bet (K9/A9) and is the bottom of the value range.

TODO: ask at discord why the hands selection, eg why double broadway
