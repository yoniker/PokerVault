## Flop

vs a BB lead, BU has a very small raise frequency, its raise range consists of the vulenrable pps (99,TT,JJ) infrequently,sets(sometimes/infrequent),backdoor straights (QJ,JT,J9) infrequently,and some A-Xo with Aspades (infrequently)

vs a BB check, ATC can bet here, air bets here sometimes, sets pure, overpairs bet in reverse proportion to their rank

## Turn

After flop goes X/X on a 3d when BB goes B75, AK is pure continue (infrequent raise)

## River


After flop goes X/X on a 3d when BB goes B75, AKdd calls,Tc river, BB goes B50,AK is still a continue (either as a call or a bluff-raise)
