## Flop:
Board 10, BB leads for 1.8BB on the flop, BU's reaction is to rarely raise.
For value BU raises infrequently hands that need more protection like 99,TT,JJ, A8.
As a bluff he raises infrequently hands that have one overcard and a bd straight like J7. T9s with a bd flush raises the most (sometimes)

Board 10, when BB X, BU's global frequency is 55%. The Kx offsuit that bet more are ones with Kx when the K has a suit from the board like Ks,Kh or Kd, or when the kicker can later fall back into a straight more often (so K7o bets close to pure but KcTd bets infrequently)

## Turn

Board 10 flop goes X/B30/C turn 7s X it's on me as BU.
With combo draws like Qs9s or any 9x with two spades I bet pure (including As9s), 99-QQ bet pure, straights bet pure, sets bet frequently.
Other combo draws like Ks5s Qs5s Js5s bet frequently to pure

Board 10 flop goes B33/C turn 4d B20 it's on BU, A9 is the first Ax which is indifferent

Flop goes X/X turn Ks, BB B20, against that BU raises KJ infrequently KQ sometimes, AK raises very infrequently and two pair like K6/K8 raise pure
