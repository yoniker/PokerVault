## Flop

ATC can bet, underpairs  77-55 check pure with no spade and bet infrequently with a spade, but 22-44 with a spade bet sometimes(!). Other hands that bet infrequently- weak Jx that can't improve, 8x that can't easily improve (K8/A8)

## Turn

Flop goes X/B30/C Turn 5s, with the Qx region- BU bets sometimes AQ with Aspades and infrequently with AQ no Aspades, bets sometimes Qc9c/QhTh (notice that they have a gutshot vs stronger queens), and bets infrequently KQo(checks pure with no spade).


Flop goes X/B30/C, Turn Tc, BB X, Bu's strategy is very polorized - value region is around AK(pure bet), Kx with no sdv (so the low Kx suited region ) bet pure,  Aspades-x off bets frequently, and some flush draws and sets (except QQ with Qs which bets sometimes only) - all bet 2x pot when they bet.

## River

Flop went X/B30/C Turn 7h X/X river 5c X and it's on BU.
AJ is the bottom of the mandatory value bet region (bets pure), KJ bets sometimes (Qx bets pure)
