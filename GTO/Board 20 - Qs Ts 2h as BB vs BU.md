## Flop

## Turn

Flop goes X/X turn Qd, BB bets frequently with flush draws (unless the fds has SDV)

## River

Flop X/X Turn Qd B73/C river Ac it's on BB.
BB bets pure his Qx region for value (frequently overbet, infrequently B50) ,and A-x of spades (B50) or AT(frequently)
BB almost never bets his missed flush draws as a bluff. Instead as a bluff, he bluffs all his J-x region pure (including the offsuit region which is just J9 as other Jx don't get here or are value eg JT is a pair and didn't lead turn QJ is trips, KJ is a straight) unless the holdings has a spade in them (and then he gives up pure)

Flop X/X Turn Ah X/X river Jc, with his Kx region, BB bets more when he doesn't have a card which blocks BU's check back range. So K2s-K8s bet pure for value, while KT (blocks BU's check back range) bets sometimes, K9 also bets sometimes as now BU is less likely to have 9T/9J/9Q/A9 which check back as well.
