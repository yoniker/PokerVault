## Flop

## Turn

Flop goes X/X turn Qd, BB bets frequently with flush draws (unless the fds has SDV)

## River

Flop X/X Turn Qd B73/C river it's on BB.
BB bets pure his Qx region for value (frequently overbet, infrequently B50) ,and A-x of spades (B50) or AT(frequently)
BB almost never bets his missed flush draws as a bluff. Instead as a bluff, he bluffs all his J-x region pure (including the offsuit region which is just J9 as other Jx don't get here or are value eg JT is a pair and didn't lead turn QJ is trips, KJ is a straight) unless the holdings has a spade in them (and then he gives up pure)
