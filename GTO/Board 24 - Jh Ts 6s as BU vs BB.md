## Flop

On the flop, BU can bet ATC, As-x bet frequently unless they have sdv. Underpairs with no spades check pure, or bet infrequently, global frequency is 67% and BU bets air 77% of the time,sets bet pure,OESD bet frequently

X/B30/R90 BU's strategy is:
ATo without As is a pure fold(!)
Jx no spade is indifferent (sometimes fold),
88/99 with a spade (double backdoor) always continues,otherwise pure fold,
overpairs always continue,

## Turn

Flop X/B30/C Turn 5c, BU's turn strategy is very polorized (185% pot), betting pure sets/QQ/KK (AA sometimes check back), betting frequently with 5x if x is high (A/K) as a bluff,flush draws bet frequently, Q9o bets pure with a spade and checks close to pure without, KQ bets frequent with a spade,without a spade KQo bets frequent but KQs bets very infrequent(I don't think this is significant),A9 is too strong to bluff, the threshold of value region is J9 (infrequent)

## River

Flop X/B30/C Turn Ah X/B58/C river 3h x /?
BU likes to bet Kh-x off, Qh-xoff (pure or almost pure),threshold hand for value betting river is AJ+ (AT is very infrequent),sets straights and flushes bet pure for a potsize bet
