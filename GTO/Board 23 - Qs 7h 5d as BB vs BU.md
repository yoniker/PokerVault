## Flop

X/B50, BB is indifferent with A9cc/A8cc (no backdoor equity!)- calls sometimes/infrequently, i guess since it can "cooler" some 7x/5x hands betting the flop

X/B33 it's on BB, with the 6x region: he never X/R with J6s even with bd flush draw as he doesn't have the overcard as well. K6s with backdoor X/R frequently (Kc6c without bd pure folds),A6 same-infrequently,96s infrequently, 86 sometimes

## Turn

## River
Flop X/X
Turn 3h X/X 
River Qc, BB leads almost pure with 5x/7x unless it has the A (in which case it checks pure because it blocks BU's checkback range),Full houses sometimes check, Trips (Qx) bet frequently.
