## Flop

Global betting frequency for BU is 50%, ATC can bet, the least frequent are double broadways no bd flush, most frequent are sets and Aspades-x with a low kicker

## Turn

After flop went X/X on Qc turn, for value BU bets with Q9+(sometimes or frequently), and as a bluff Kx,Tx (especially ones that also block 65 or have a gutshot like T8), and Aspades-X and A-X of spades. AJ pure checks back

Flop goes B30/C Turn Qh X it's on BU, Jx Qx with a flushdraw bet at a higher frequency than ones without a flushdraw (JT or worse pure check without fd but bet at some frequency with a flushdraw)

## River

Flop X/X Turn Jh  B75/C River 9d B50 JT+ raises the river either frequently or pure, worse Jx call.


Action got checked through to the river, Turn 9h river 5s, BB B120, 
 BU does the following: 
 with AKo:since BB checks a lot nut flushes and bets more with K high flushes, raises Aspades/Kspades infrequently with a slight preference to Kspades (other AKo pure fold),
 With A5o/A4o/A3o he pure calls,
 With AQo Aspades/Qspades infrequently raise
 76 is good enough to raise (even just 7h6h)
 it's indifferent with both TT and Kh5h but calls more frequently with hands that connected with the board like Kh5h than with hands that didn't connect like TT
