## Flop

Any two can bet here, the only pure checks are broadways without any of the suits hearts/spades, top pair good kicker frequently bets (close to pure)

## Turn

After flop goes X/B30/C, on Ts, BU frequently bets his flushes  

On B30(BB lead)/C and BB X, on a As turn card I never bet underpairs like 88-KK(with or without a spade). Just top pair infrequently, sometimes flushes, sometimes flush draws and air bets sometimes as well

After flop goes X/X, on 9h turn BB goes B30, the only hands that fold as BU are broadways no flush cards. The nuts (86s) raise all the time, and the bluffs are around 6x 8x (like J6,Q8)
