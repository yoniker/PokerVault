## Flop

Flop goes X/B73, BB continues with:
most pair on the board (K6s/Q6s/T6s/76s no backdoors are indifferent, any Jx, 9x are pure calls except ones like T9/T7 which block some of BU's bluffs), flush draws,OESD(QT,87),
Mostly folding:77,88,Txhh
Bluffs infrequently: KQo with Ks,6h5h
In general flush draws infrequently X/R here.

## Turn

## River

Flop goes X/X Turn As X/X river 3h, the bottom of BB's lead-for-value range is KJ. Ax leads a ton (frequently to pure)

Flop X/X Turn Tc X/X River 6d, BB sometimes bets his Tx for value (bets less when he has "three pair" like JT/T9 as this blocks BU's check back range).

Flop X/B50/C Turn 5d X/X river Ah,
AJo infrequently leads as it blocks a lot of BU's check back range
