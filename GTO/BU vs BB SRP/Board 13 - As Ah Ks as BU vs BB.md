## Flop
not surprisingly, it's a range bet

## Turn

After flop went X/B30/C Turn 6c, BU bets infrequently his air hands

## River

After flop went X/B30/C turn 8s went X/X and river is 8d, Ax frequently overbets and infrequently bets small

Flop X/B30/C Turn Qd X/X river 5h BB leads B50, then BU raises more with AJ/AT (frequently) than A7 (sometimes) - I supposed because of the JT blockers - BB has less hands he can call with

Flop X/B30/C Turn 2d X/X river 9s BB X. KT is the bottom of BU's value range but it bets frequently (K9 bets very infrequently regardless of the suits)

Flop X/B30/C Turn 6d X/X river QC BB goes B50, BU's primary bluffs are J6s, T6s and Q6s - sometimes shove all-in
