## Flop


When flop goes X/B120, BB is actually indifferent with some Ax, especially ones with no kicker and no bd draws/no spades, QJo no spades is a pure fold

## Turn

After flop goes X/X, on a turn 7d, with AQo BB overbets pure, BB has two sizings (B75,B250), the overbet sizing is top two,sets,some flush draws,some two pairs,
B75 with Ax (A7+ can bet infrequently),flush draws and infrequently sets.
The low equity hands that BB bluff are 4 pair (7x),and infrequently small pairs with a spade (22-55)

After flop goes X/X, on Ac turn goes X/B50, BB pure calls only Qx and Ax, small pairs call infrequently/sometimes if holding a spade (the higher the rank the more they call)

## River

Flop goes X/B120/C Turn 9s X/B60/C river 3h X/B100
BB is actually indifferent with Ax (infrequently calls) and indifferent with flushes (sometimes call)
