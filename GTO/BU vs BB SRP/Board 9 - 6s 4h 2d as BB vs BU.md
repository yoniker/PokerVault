## Flop



## Turn

After flop goes X/X on Ah, BB leads with a very polorized range (250% pot bet), and his range is: sets- sometimes, the nuts(53)-sometimes, 5x with the flush draw and an overcard (J5hh)-pure, 5x without the flushdraw (J5cc)-sometimes, Q high flush draws without SDV - close to pure, Khigh flush draws - pure checks(!).

On a 3 turn after flop went X/X, 99 pure bets (value and protection) on this 4 to a straight board

On 3h turn after flop went X/X, BB leads a lot(43% global frequency): with air frequently (especially one heart hands like QTo), bets frequently with 5x, Top pair good kicker bets frequently (Q6+), A9+ KT+ pure checks with or without a heart.

## River

Flop goes X/X On a T turn X/X, K river, the better Kx of BB (KJ,K6) check sometimes while middling kings (K7-K9) bet 

Flop goes X/X On a T turn X/X, blank, AT bets only infrequently while other Tx are betting pure
