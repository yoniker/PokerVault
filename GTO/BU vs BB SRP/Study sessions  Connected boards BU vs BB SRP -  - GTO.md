Flop 8s5h4s X/X Turn 4d X/? BU never bets AJ as value/denial, AK with no spade bets infrequently, 22 bets sometimes without a spade and bets frequently with a spade

Flop Ts8h6d X/B30/R90 BU sometimes call with T9s and sometimes raises - it can make better hands to fold (like AT) and some worse hands to call (like 9x)

AsQhJd X/? Bu's flop strategy - ATC, 78% global frequency, so even A2 bet frequently
