Flop 8s5h4s X/X Turn 4d X/? BU never bets AJ as value/denial, AK with no spade bets infrequently, 22 bets sometimes without a spade and bets frequently with a spade

Flop Ts8h6d X/B30/R90 BU sometimes call with T9s and sometimes raises - it can make better hands to fold (like AT) and some worse hands to call (like 9x)

AsQhJd X/? Bu's flop strategy - ATC, 78% global frequency, so even A2 bet frequently

Flop 5s4h2s X/X Turn 3c BB bets B20, BU infrequently raises with a 6x, and very infrequently raises with air (two overcards) specifically from the 7x and 8x region (sometimes)

Flop 7s5h3d B30/C Turn 2h B30 it's on BU. 
Bu raises sometimes with hands that need some denial like 88/99/TT/JJ, close to pure with A7, frequently with a straight (A4) sometimes with 4x with no SDV, infrequently with a flush draw, very infrequently with A-high
