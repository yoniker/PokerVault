TcTh, flop comes KcJd6c sb B75, BU should fold sometimes and sometimes call (it's not a pure call) - vs this sb big c-bet size, BU can call his Kx, most of his Jx (infrequently fold QJ and sometimes JT as those block some draws) flush draws and 76

On 9c7d3c, vs a B75 continuation bet by sb, with AQ it's important to hold one club: My outs are cleaner (hitting the club card means a flush didn't complete), and I have some backdoor equity.
Without holding a club this becomes a much worse call. Same goes for 66 with or without a club

AQo can raise sometimes on AhJd5c, as sb will bet his range, and this hand is ahead of much of sb's range. While of course sb can have AK/JJ, his continuation range vs our raise is also smaller Ax, a ton of draws etc. Against his entire range, AQo is doing great.
