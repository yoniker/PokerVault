# Flop
## SB's strategy:

SB has both unique hands that BU cannot have like AA/AK/KK, as well as more Kx (KJo,KQo) so sb has a big range advantage on this board and c-bets often (70%).
Let's think about his range:

### Kx/AA
Bet very frequently (most of the time).

### Suited Ax:
Suited hearts bet frequently, suited spades - sometimes
Ax of other suites - infrequently

### Suited broadways
Even the worse of those (QJdd) have bd equity, so those hands bet frequently.


### Underpairs
i think that QQ/JJ/TT/99 bet frequently! (just a little bit less than the global frequency)
### Sets
Sets bet frequently

Summary: The bulk of sb's range is around strong hands like Kx/sets and that allows hands like QJdd (suited broadways with no even bd fd) and QQ/JJ  to bet frequently for this value/protection


## BU's strategy vs a c-bet(that will happen 70% of the time):

Let's analyze his range by subranges:

### Pocket pairs:


The best pocker pair BU can have is 99.
88/77 make a set - that will be the only nutted hands in BU's range other than some combo draws. Of course 88/77 continue. I think that 66 can fold at this point if no spade, 66 with a spade has both backdoor straight and bd flush so I think that it can continue.
55- pure fold with or without a spade

### Suited broadway
Kx continue pure, any two spades continue pure

QJ/QT continue only with spades (the backdoor hearts can do either call or fold)
JT is a nutshot and should continue pure

### Suited Ax
AQs/AJs/ATs continues with frontdoor or bd flush, with no backdoor flush those hands are indifferent(sometimes call sometimes fold)

Suited wheel Ax fold with no bd flushdraw

### Suited connectors
All those hands had equity (at least a gutshot to the nuts) and continue pure

### Offsuit broadways
Only AQo is there, continues with any spade pure (Aspades/Qspades) folds otherwise

Overall button strategy vs a c-bet: Since BU has only very few hands with a lot of equity (88/77/JsTs and infrequently 87s) BU can only continue by calling and almost never raising.


# Turn

On the turn the pot is about 40BBs, and the player have 80BBs so SPR is 2.

## Blank low
2,3,4,5

SB will B63, bulk part of value range is going to be KT+ (KT is the threshold hand-bets sometimes)
Slowplays- KK can check sometimes, and AA infrequently?
Bluffs- Flush draws, a wheeled A-x bets more often than QJhh as it has an overcard out.
Underpairs infrequently bet

## Blank Broadway:
A/Q not of spades







## Straight completers
J,9,6,T
5?

## Flush completers
As,Qs,2s/3s

## Board pairing
K,8,7
