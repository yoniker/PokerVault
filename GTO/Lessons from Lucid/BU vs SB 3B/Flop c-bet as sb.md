On AdJd3c, while sb bets often (65% of the time),  AA specifically bet only 35% of the time (let villian hit his set with a lower pair,why not). ThTc bet there infrequently, and X/F is correct without a flush draw vs B50.

6d6h turn themselves into a bluff at a high frequency with 6d (without the diamond it sometimes bet sometimes check).
