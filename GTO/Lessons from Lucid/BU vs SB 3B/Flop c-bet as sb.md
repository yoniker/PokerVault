On AdJd3c, while sb bets often (65% of the time),  AA specifically bet only 35% of the time (let villian hit his set with a lower pair,why not). ThTc bet there infrequently, and X/F is correct without a flush draw vs B50.

6d6h turn themselves into a bluff at a high frequency with 6d (without the diamond it sometimes bet sometimes check).

On Qd8d2h:

1. KK with no diamond like KhKs  bet frequently for a large sizing(B80), the idea is that by the river this hand often downgrades to a medium-strength hand, on safe turn it shoves.
KK with Kd splits between betting big and betting medium - it doesn't downgrade as much on many runouts.

2. KJo without a diamond bets sometimes on this board anyways (for a smaller sizing-B25), same idea for ATo/AJo - I don't want to play vs stronger ranges without the equity or blockers to it

On 9c7d5c:
	1. Bet frequency is about 40%
	2. Vulenrable overpairs like TT-QQ bet frequently for a large sizing
	3. KK/AA bet a bit less (KK with clubs sometimes without clubs frequently, AA with club bet infrequently and without clubs frequently)
	4. KJo/KQo bet frequently with a club and never without a club (it gives me more equity and future bluffs on further streets as well as blocking BU's continuation range)
	5. 66/88 bet only infrequently(with club infrequently, without even less).
