On AdJd3c, while sb bets often (65% of the time),  AA specifically bet only 35% of the time (let villian hit his set with a lower pair,why not). ThTc bet there infrequently, and X/F is correct without a flush draw vs B50.

6d6h turn themselves into a bluff at a high frequency with 6d (without the diamond it sometimes bet sometimes check).

On Qd8d2h:

1. KK with no diamond like KhKs  bet frequently for a large sizing(B80), the idea is that by the river this hand often downgrades to a medium-strength hand, on safe turn it shoves.
KK with Kd splits between betting big and betting medium - it doesn't downgrade as much on many runouts.

2. KJo without a diamond bets sometimes on this board anyways (for a smaller sizing-B25), same idea for ATo/AJo - I don't want to play vs stronger ranges without the equity or blockers to it

On 9c7d5c:
	1. Bet frequency is about 40%
	2. Vulenrable overpairs like TT-QQ bet frequently for a large sizing
	3. KK/AA bet a bit less (KK with clubs sometimes without clubs frequently, AA with club bet infrequently and without clubs frequently)
	4. KJo/KQo bet frequently with a club and never without a club (it gives me more equity and future bluffs on further streets as well as blocking BU's continuation range)
	5. 66/88 bet only infrequently(with club infrequently, without even less).

On Ad3d2c:
Overall betting frequency of sb is very low (80% check)! TODO check why
The hand that bets the most is AK (infrequently to sometimes)
Hand that bluff the most is KQo/KJo with one diamond (infrequently). 
Overall the spot is being played very passively.

On 2s3s4s:
SB checks range (sb lacks the nut advantage and has many unmade hands so his range need extra protection which is given by checking)

On 9d7d5d:
SB still bets sometimes(!) in general. The ideas are that:
1. Overpairs are in a good shape now but will lose a ton of value later on
2. SB has a lot of overcard with a diamond, so has a lot of equity in his range.


ATC can bet actually(even As4s), all for a small size, making two overcards like KhQh indifferent.
JcJh bet frequently

On AsQs3s SB frequently checks his range (80%) as he's lacking flushes (the As in particular is blocking a lot of sb suited hands, and the Qs blocks a bit more), so even hands as strong as AQo bet infrequently (just a bit more than global frequency)

On Ac8d2c, SB bets very frequently(90%), so even a hand like KK which c-bet the least, bets frequently(78%).

On TsTd5c sb bets range! for 50% pot (TODO check why)
