## SB's strategy:

SB has both unique hands that BU cannot have like AA/AK/KK, as well as more Kx (KJo,KQo) so sb has a big range advantage on this board and c-bets often (70%).
Let's think about his range:

### Kx/AA
Bet very frequently (most of the time).

### Suited Ax:
Suited hearts bet frequently, suited spades - sometimes
Ax of other suites - infrequently

### Suited broadways
Even the worse of those (QJdd) have bd equity, so those hands bet frequently.


### Underpairs
i think that QQ/JJ/TT/99 bet frequently! (just a little bit less than the global frequency)
### Sets
Sets bet frequently

Summary: The bulk of sb's range is around strong hands like Kx/sets and that allows hands like QJdd (suited broadways with no even bd fd) and QQ/JJ  to bet frequently for this value/protection


## BU's strategy vs a c-bet(that will happen 70% of the time):

Let's analyze his range by subranges:

### Pocket pairs:


The best pocker pair BU can have is 99.
88/77 make a set - that will be the only nutted hands in BU's range other than some combo draws. Of course 88/77 continue. I think that 66 can fold at this point if no spade, 66 with a spade has both backdoor straight and bd flush so I think that it can continue.
55- pure fold with or without a spade

### Suited broadway
Kx continue pure, any two spades continue pure

QJ/QT with no bd flush has only bd straight- not good enough QJ with 
JT is a nutshot and should continue pure

### Suited Ax
AQ continues with or without bd flash (strong pair draw plus bd broadway)
AT has many good turns (6/9/J) so i suspect it continues more than AJ

Suited wheel Ax fold with no bd flushdraw
