BU vs CO as BU 3-bet pot

Qc9c5c, CO checks BU bets range(!)

SB vs BB SRP, on 995r, J6/Q6 bets way more than something like J4/Q2, because the 6x is now an out too vs BB's 5x. This small boost in equity is enough to tip the scales- much like a backdoor flush draw.

SB vs BB SRP, on 8c7d4c sb checks at a very high frequency on the flop (even sets mostly check) -TODO check what happens if not

SB vs BB SRP, 773 is checked a lot by SB while TT2 is almost a range bet, TODO figure out why.

SB vs BB SRP, AsKc9s, SB is checking a lot - wtf and why

SB vs BB SR flop As3s2d, it was claimed that the nut advantage is because BB calls 54o and sb folds, TODO check to what extent this is true

LJ vs BB SRP, flop comes 8c6d3c, LJ bets KhTh frequently because of "lack of natural draws" and backdoor straight draw plus two overcards
