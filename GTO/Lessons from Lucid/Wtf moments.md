BU vs CO as BU 3-bet pot

Qc9c5c, CO checks BU bets range(!)

SB vs BB SRP, on 995r, J6/Q6 bets way more than something like J4/Q2, because the 6x is now an out too vs BB's 5x. This small boost in equity is enough to tip the scales- much like a backdoor flush draw.

SB vs BB SRP, on 8c7d4c sb checks at a very high frequency on the flop (even sets mostly check) -TODO check what happens if not

SB vs BB SRP, 773 is checked a lot by SB while TT2 is almost a range bet, TODO figure out why.
