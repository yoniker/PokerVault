## Flop

Flop X/B50, BB folds 66- with no spade (has enough one pair hands/ gutshots etc)

## Turn

Flop X/X,  Turn 4h,  betting "for protection" as BB here is not a thing with stuff like Q8, BB bets a lot of his flush draws, gutshots, Kx, and some naked Ah-X offsuit or As-X offsuite like As-5d, Ah-5c with no SDV

Flop X/X, if the turn is 3h then only K9+ lead as BB  (K5/K6 don't have an extra equity), whereas if turn is 4h then K5/K6 can bet infrequently due to their extra equity (a gutshot)

## River


Flop X/X, Turn Kd X/X river Qh BB leads B50, BU Raises R100, Q8s is the "nut bluff" of BB eg the only hand with any significant raise as a bluff frequency

Flop X/X Turn 2h B73/C, River Qh, as BB,sets bet pure for value, and lower spades bet pure as a bluff (many other hand types i didnt mention)
