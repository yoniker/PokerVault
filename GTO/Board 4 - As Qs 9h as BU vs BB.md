## Flop

Betting strategy is quite mergy. Any Ax bets sometimes. Stronger Qx bets sometimes. Underpairs like 77- bet sometimes with a spade

## Turn

After betting the flop with Jx/Tx hh, when turn is Qh giving me a combo draw, it's a high frequency bet, while Axhh sometimes bet sometimes check (those high equity hands have a lot of SDV), TT,JJ etc bet infrequently

## River

After action was checked to the river, on a 9dAc runout, Ax and 9x and even KQ/QJ overbet for value. 
Bluff comes from Jx,and small pocket pairs and other hands with no SDV- but theory prefers spade cards than not having a spade card to bluff as the BU.

After flop went X/X, river BB led for 50% BU called on JsQh runout, the threshold hand for betting for value on the river is trips. Trips,straights and flushes all bet pure.
