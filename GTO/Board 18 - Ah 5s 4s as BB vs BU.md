## Flop

## Turn

Flop went X/X Turn Qc, BB X,
with ATo BU bets sometimes, with bigger kickers pure , with lower kickers infrequently

Flop went X/X turn Jh, I almost never bet Jx even with spades (JsTs is an exception)

Flop went X/X turn 7h, BB B115, then BU's underpair: KK pure calls except when having no heart no spades, QQ is indifferent, lower underpairs than QQ pure fold unless it's exactly hearts-spades combo

## River

Flop goes X/X
Turn 9s BB B73 BU C River Th, BB B125, with As6c BU sometimes calls, infrequently folds, infrequently raises as a bluff. In general with the AXo region, without any spade, BU folds pure unless it's two pair (it's indifferent with A4o no spades btw).

Flop goes X/B30/C Turn 4d X/X river Kd X/?
BU bets pure any Ax, and bets his air infrequently

Flop goes X/X Turn 9c B252/C river B30, with Ks6s BU pure calls and never raises(!).
Ax and Js9s infrequently turns itself into a bluff (yes,trips and flushes into a bluff) and shoves all in. 54s pure shove bluff all-in. GTO expects some strong hands like Kx of spades (nut flush) to fold, and 55 to be indifferent and mostly fold (44 pure calls btw) - and I don't expect people to pure fold nut flushes, or to fold a lot of full houses there.
