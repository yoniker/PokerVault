## Flop

## Turn

Flop went X/X Turn 6d, BB's betting strategy is very polorized with the main sizing as 2.5 pot (around the 7x region mostly but some 8x/3x region too,AQ infrequently bet).


## River

Flop X/X Turn 6s X/X River 2c, with his Ax region BB pure leads, unless it's A4/A5/A6 and then sometimes (this is because BB blocks BU's auto check back range)

Flop X/X Turn 7h X/X River Qc it's on BB: BB never bets just a Q here for value- it has tons of Ax that do bet here
