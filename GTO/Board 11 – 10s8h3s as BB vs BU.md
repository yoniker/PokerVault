## Flop 

## Turn

	After flop c hecked through, Kc turn, BB can sometimes lead with straight draws (J9,97,88) flush draws, and some value hands like bottom set, two pair,  KJ/KT.
I can sometimes lead a lot on the turn with flush draws/Top pair/sets/two pair after flop went X/X.

On a board pairing T, I can X/R with T but also with K/Q/J high flushes, A high flushes are more passive usually

If I X/R the flop with AT (top top), gets 3-bet on the flop, call, and the turn is a spade, I pure fold(!), continue more with two pair/sets or one pair plus a spade in my hand
## River

on Qs 9x I can still lead and value bet top pair good kicker

On polorizing boards like A on the turn and 8 on the river, BB's lead range should be polorized to Ax plus, 8x, and the worst missed draws like 65ss, and use overbet sizing

On Q turn K river, when action checks through, BB can be for value a very depolerized range, JT+ (third pair), and bluff a lot  with Jx

If I have Tx turn is 3 and river is 3, I want to lead frequently with Tx no A, and check more with AT (with AT I block his Ax which check back river so he is more likely to bluff)
