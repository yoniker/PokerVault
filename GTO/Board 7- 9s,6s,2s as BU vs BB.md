## Flop 

Every hand can bet at some frequency except AT-AQ no spade, hands with a spade no SDV or 7/8 are betting at a higher frequency

## Turn

After flop went X/X, if on a 3 turn, and BB bets small, a overcard+gutshot no spade type of hand can raise. As with a gutshot like A5,A4 raises close to pure, whereas a hand like A7o with As is more passive

On a 4 turn after flop went X/X, BU mostly bluff with 5x,3x and spades, and infrequently random double broadway no spade hands. The stronger the broadway spade the more im likely to bet it.

After betting the flop,on a K turn, the Axo which bet the most are the ones with no SDV. AQ/AJ with As bet sometimes.
