## Flop

## Turn


## River
On a K turn and 3 river, I (close to pure)  lead with any Q or K after flop and turn goes X/X

flop goes X/B30/C turn X/X,on 9h 3d (it's a 4 to a straight board):
1. With Axss missed flush draws, I almost always bluff
2. Tx bets more frequently if i have a spade in my hand, AT with Aspade bets pure as BB (BU NEVER bets it! - BB can represent value on the river as he's uncapped, BU cannot as he capped himself on the turn),AT with Tspades bets frequently, KT with Kspades bets pure, other KT bet infrequently, this is because I block their automatic fold range, and so BU is more likely to call me.
