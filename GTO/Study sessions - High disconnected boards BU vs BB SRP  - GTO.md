BU vs BB SRP, flop Qs8h3s, with the specific junk region of low Kx/Qx/Jx with no backdoor flush  (like Jd4d/Qc2c) , BU bets infrequently.


## Turn

KsQh6s X/B30/R90/C Turn 7s BB bets B100, with his open-ended region (JT): BU folds all of his JTo that have a spade or a heart (because then villian is blocked from having a spade or a heart), and only sometimes call the remaining two combos of JTo. With JTs it's the same: obviously JhTh/JsTs call (OESD+Flush draw), JdTd/JcTc sometimes call (as they unblock hearts and spades draws) and sometimes fold





## River
BU vs BB SRP, Flop Ks9h5s X/X , Turn 4c X/X River, River Kd X/? BU's bottom of value region is 66  which bets pure (A5 pure check back)

BU vs BB SRP, flop AhQs8s X/B30/C turn 5h x/x river 6d X it's on BU, any AX bets river pure (even middling/weak Ax like A7o), bottom of value range is KQo (betting infrequently)
