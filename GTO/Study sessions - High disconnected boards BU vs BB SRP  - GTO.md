## Turn

KsQh6s X/B30/R90/C Turn 7s BB bets B100, with his open-ended region (JT): BU folds all of his JTo that have a spade or a heart (because then villian is blocked from having a spade or a heart), and only sometimes call the remaining two combos of JTo. With JTs it's the same: obviously JhTh/JsTs call (OESD+Flush draw), JdTd/JcTc sometimes call (as they unblock hearts and spades draws) and sometimes fold
