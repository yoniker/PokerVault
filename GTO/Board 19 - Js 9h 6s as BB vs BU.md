## Flop

## Turn

## River

Flop goes X/X Turn As X/X river 3h, the bottom of BB's lead-for-value range is KJ. Ax leads a ton (frequently to pure)

Flop X/X Turn Tc X/X River 6d, BB sometimes bets his Tx for value (bets less when he has "three pair" like JT/T9 as this blocks BU's check back range).

Flop X/B50/C Turn 5d X/X river Ah,
AJo infrequently leads as it blocks a lot of BU's check back range
