1 – INTRO POSTFLOP

→ Use only 1 sizing per street  
→ If you have studied T85r, you now know how to play most dry T-high boards. Don't waste your time trying to study every spot  
→ Always ask yourself: "How is my opponent going to react to my play?" “Is he gonna play like GTO?” “If not, how can I exploit his deviation?”

2 – 3BET IP THEORY

→ Don’t range 1/3 the flop  
→ Cbet big on dry boards and small on drawy boards. If you bet big on drawy boards, you isolate yourself against high equity hands. But if you bet big on dry boards, he will have to call single paired hands that have low equity against your overpairs.

- →  That’s why:
    
    - T74r: 2/3 cbet  
    - T74fd: 40% cbet - J98fd: 1/4 cbet  
    - Q85m: 1/4 cbet
    
    3 – 3BET IP EXPLOIT
    
- →  Population overfolds and under XR: increase your cbetting frequency on most boards
    
    4 – 3BET IP TURNS
    
- →  It's okay to give up sometimes, the money was made on the flop because your opponent overfolded
    

- →  You can still put pressure on the turn, especially when: - 1/3 the flop and 3/4 the turn on bricks (KT5fd 2r)  
    - 2/3 the flop and 1/2 the turn on overcards (T84r Kr)
    
    5–3BETOOP
    
- →  Stop using 1/3 cbets except on Axx, KQJ, QT5m...
    
- →  Use big bets or check instead
    
- →  Checking is a good option because the population will:
    
    - overfold vs XR, especially when leading 1/3 - overfold vs 3/4 when they XB on the flop
    
    6–SRPIP
    
- →  An ultra-simplified but well-executed strategy will always be better than a complex, balanced but poorly executed one  
    → Instead of trying to memorize every strategy on every flop without understanding why, try to visualize what your action accomplishes: "If I bet 1/3 here, he will fold this part of his range, but definitely call that part... If I bet 2/3, he might fold that part instead..."
    
    → Visualizing what your bet size accomplishes will help you because:  
    - When you get to the turn/river, you know what his range looks like  
    - You know which turns/rivers will be good for you or for him  
    - If you think your opponent overcalls vs 1/3 but overfolds vs 2/3, you can 1/3 for value and 2/3
    
    as a bluff
    

→ You can high-frequency 1/3 cbet against fish + nits, but you should have bigger bets against aggro regs because they XR enough  
→ Ice skating works well at low stakes because population is too face-up: 1/3 the flop, 1/3 on game-changing turns, and every time they just call, you know you can overbluff because they’re capped

7–SRPOOP

→ The high-frequency 1/3 cbet isn’t as effective as when we’re IP, but population still overfolds to 1/3 cbet

- →  Checking is good because:
    
    - Every time they XB, you can overbluff  
    - Every time fish + nits lead with a big size, you can overfold and under XR - Every time regs lead, you can go for a XR
    
    Overall Tips
    
- →  Overbluff vs weakness (small range cbet / XB / just call when they would raise their good hands)  
    → Overfold vs strength (big cbet / XR / triple barrel / overbet / river jam)
