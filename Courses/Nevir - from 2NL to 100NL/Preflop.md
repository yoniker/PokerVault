We will look at GTOW to have an idea of the baseline strategy, and always ask how we should deviate.

For example, at a random flop QT2r BU vs BB SRP flop X/B30 the BB should x/r at some frequency with hands like QJ, K2, J8 with backdoor flush. Will the population play like that? No. Our goal is to find the best deviation to exploit our opponents' tendencies.

Nevir has a lot of data on hands, and we will see this in hand2note. We will use simple preflop to find exploits preflop, and GTOW-AI to find exploits postflop(when those are not obvious).

### Why should I study preflop?

Many players who approached Nevir wanted him to teach him postflop.
Because it's the most frequent street, and mistakes in this street will cost me on other streets (for example, calling with a weak hand vs a 3-bet)

### When should I study preflop?
As soon as I start studying poker seriously

### How should I study preflop?
Using GTOW. Nevir himself simplified the low-frequency strategies of BB for example, such that everything will be pure or sometimes, by using a setting on simple preflop.

By importing his hand histories to hand2note, he was able to build a database showing population's tendencies. Also, I can see my own stats. Compare them to GTO by comparing that spot to GTOW's stats. 

If GTOW opens 24% and population opens 21% (which seems to be not a big deal, only a difference of 3%,right?) the actual different is (24-21)/24 = 12.5% -> It's a huge difference

## Preflop Fundamentals
1.  In an unopened pot, Never limp. Always open raise or fold
2. Don't flat call an open  - always 3-bet or fold
3. Don't cold call a 3-bet: When someone opens and someone else 3-bets (both players are not me), 4-bet or fold

Sizings preflop:
from LJ/HJ 2BB,
CO 2.2BB
BU 2.5BB
sb 3BB

3-bet sizing:
IP - 6.5-8BB
OOP-10-12BB

a common mistake: Some players bet too small vs UTG's 2BB open since they like to use the 3x IP/ 4x OOP 3-bet rule. This rule is great for beginners, but will cause me to make mistakes like 3-betting too small.

4-bet sizing:
IP: 20-24, OOP: 19-22

Range types:
1. Polorized: Strong hands + weak hands, no middling hands
2. Linear(merged): Strong and medium hands, maybe a few weak hands
When should I use linear/polorized ranges to 4-bet?

When I'm IP:
IP I can call more middling hands profitable, so I should use polorized range (my OOP opponent doesn't want to play OOP so he will 5-bet jam a lot more often)

When I'm OOP:
My opponent will have the positional advantage postflop, so he will call way more often (he wants to see a flop) and therefore I want to raise a linear range.

For example, BU vs sb 3bet has a slightly more polorized (still merged but slighly more polorized) than, say, CO vs BU's 3bet which is more linear.

BB vs SB is different- BB expects SB to 4-bet a lot (SB is OOP), so he 3-bets polorized.
