We will look at GTOW to have an idea of the baseline strategy, and always ask how we should deviate.

For example, at a random flop QT2r BU vs BB SRP flop X/B30 the BB should x/r at some frequency with hands like QJ, K2, J8 with backdoor flush. Will the population play like that? No. Our goal is to find the best deviation to exploit our opponents' tendencies
