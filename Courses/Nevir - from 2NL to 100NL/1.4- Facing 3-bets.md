We saw that population is 3-betting too tight, and call too much vs 3-bets.
So, how should I play vs 3-bets? Since they are 3-betting too tight, the first intuition is to just fold and make a lot of money this way. While this is true, we also need to consider how population reacts to 4-bets. If population reacts poorly to 4-bets, this might be even more +EV than folding.

## How to play vs 4bet: (CALL / FOLD / 5BET)

## Aggro regs : 3bet > 8.5% / no flat

| NL50 Regs | SB       | BTN      | CO       | HJ       |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BB        | 25/56/19 | 21/56/23 | 22/52/26 | 31/49/20 |
| SB        | ❌        | 19/60/21 | 20/58/22 | 24/54/22 |
| BTN       | ❌        | ❌        | 28/57/15 | 33/55/13 |
| CO        | ❌        | ❌        | ❌        | 33/54/13 |
How to read those tables:

In the first table for example, SB opened, BB 3-bet, SB 4-bet and now it's on BB.
BB in theory should call 35% of the time,fold 44% and 5-bet 21%.

So, for example, BvB, the Aggro regs fold more(56% vs 44% in theory), call less (25% vs 35%) and 5-bet less (19% vs 21%) than GTO, so their reaction to 4-bets is poor =>
