We saw that population is 3-betting too tight, and call too much vs 3-bets.
So, how should I play vs 3-bets? Since they are 3-betting too tight, the first intuition is to just fold and make a lot of money this way. While this is true, we also need to consider how population reacts to 4-bets. If population reacts poorly to 4-bets, this might be even more +EV than folding.
