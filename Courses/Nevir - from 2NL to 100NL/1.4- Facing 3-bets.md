Actionable to myself: Think how I want to expand my 4-bet range vs regs, and vs fish when it's late position (aside from CO vs BB)

We saw that population is 3-betting too tight, and call too much vs 3-bets.
So, how should I play vs 3-bets? Since they are 3-betting too tight, the first intuition is to just fold and make a lot of money this way. While this is true, we also need to consider how population reacts to 4-bets. If population reacts poorly to 4-bets, this might be even more +EV than folding.

## How do they play vs 4bet: (CALL / FOLD / 5BET)

| GTO (NL50 rake) | SB       | BTN      | CO       | HJ       |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BB              | 35/44/21 | 17/53/30 | 10/56/34 | 15/53/32 |
| SB              | ‚ùå        | 13/54/33 | 7/57/36  | 19/48/33 |
| BTN             | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | 25/53/22 | 22/54/24 |
| CO              | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | 25/53/22 |

## Fish + nits : 3bet ‚â§ 8.5 / flat possible

## Aggro regs : 3bet > 8.5% / no flat

| NL50 Regs | SB       | BTN      | CO       | HJ       |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| BB        | 25/56/19 | 21/56/23 | 22/52/26 | 31/49/20 |
| SB        | ‚ùå        | 19/60/21 | 20/58/22 | 24/54/22 |
| BTN       | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | 28/57/15 | 33/55/13 |
| CO        | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå        | 33/54/13 |
How to read those tables:

In the first table for example, SB opened, BB 3-bet, SB 4-bet and now it's on BB.
BB in theory should call 35% of the time,fold 44% and 5-bet 21%.

So, for example, BvB, the Aggro regs fold more(56% vs 44% in theory), call less (25% vs 35%) and 5-bet less (19% vs 21%) than GTO, so their reaction to 4-bets is poor.


## If they deviate so much from GTO when we 4bet, what's our strategy now?

## Summary

Yes, the population tends to under-3bet, which means you should open wide and overfold versus 3bets. However, because they play so poorly against 4bets, in many spots 4betting actually becomes more +EV than folding. They rarely 5bet enough and often call too much, especially when out of position, allowing you to play 4bet pots in position with a significant advantage.

üß† **Against players who 3bet too tightly**, calling becomes the worst of the three options, so you should aim to adopt a mostly 4bet-or-fold strategy.

### Against nits:
üö´ Overfold to 3bets from all positions, especially vs the BB.  
Only 4bet wide in:
- BTN vs SB
- CO vs SB
- CO vs BTN

Otherwise, fold everything.

---

### Against regs:
üî• Regs 3bet wider than GTO but still play poorly vs 4bets.  
4bet wide in most spots, especially vs SB and BTN.  
You can also 4bet wide vs the BB, but only from late positions (SB, BTN, CO).


What is essential from this lesson: Calling becomes the worst option of the 3 options (fold,call,4-bet) in many spots. It's an okay option only against a passive opponent who will check with his missed AK/AQ type of hands when he didn't hit anything, but against someone who can bluff calling is the worst option.
