# How to exploit the population in 3bet pots

Now that we saw how to play 3bet pots IP in theory. Let's see how we should play against the population:

How does the population play as OOP preflop caller in 3bet pot?

**BTN (hero) vs CO (villain) 3bet pot 100bb deep:** (GTO stats from Mobius Poker)

## CO vs BTN 3x

| Flop Size | XF Hero | XF Pio | XC Hero | XC Pio | XR Hero | XR Pio |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Overall   | 40      | na     | 49      | na     | 12      | na     |
| 70% flop  | 49      | 45     | 44      | 38     | 7.8     | 17     |
| 50% flop  | 42      | 41     | 48      | 41     | 11      | 18     |
| 30% flop  | 37      | 40     | 50      | 42     | 13      | 18     |

As you guys can see, the population does not play well in 3bet pot OOP against any cbet size. However, we can clearly see that they make even more mistakes against big bets.

Thanks to last course on 3bet pots, we already know which boards we should bet big on.

Let's try to nodelock and see how we should deviate from GTO to exploit the population.

|Board|Bet size|GTO FREQ|EXPLOIT FREQ|
|---|---|---|---|
|T22r|2/3|90.7%|100%|
|842r|2/3|51.7%|100%|
|973r|2/3|57.7%|91.8%|

Everytime you see a texture where you should bet 2/3, you know you can bet close to range OTF.

# What about 1/4-1/3 cbet spots?

| Board | Bet size | GTO FREQ | EXPLOIT FREQ |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| K93r  | 1/4      | 100%     |              |
| QT5r  | 1/4      | 97.7%    |              |
| JT2r  | 1/4      | 100%     |              |
| AK2r  | 1/4      | 89.6%    | 100%         |
| A73r  | 40%      | 50.7%    | 100%         |
| J97fd | 1/4      | 83.9%    | 100%         |
| A72m  | 1/4      | 28%      | 100%         |
| KQTfd | 1/4      | 87.4%    | 100%         |
In conclusion, on any board which isn't connected, since population isn't X/R enough, I should range-bet the flop for either big bet or small bet (when it's the appropriate sizing theoretically)
