# How to Play SRP OOP

**SRP OOP** = Blind vs Blind and Early Position vs BTN’s Preflop Flat

Because we are now OOP, the high-frequency 1/3 c-bet won’t be as effective as when we were IP. Villain will be able to float too many hands on the flop, and then we don’t really know what to do on the turn.

SRP are really complicated and can required years to master.
As always, our goal in this video is to simplify our strategy as much as possible so that we can memorize and execute it well.

Let’s first take a look at what GTO does, and then we will study the population tendencies to try to find exploits.

The first way to have a feeling for those spots is look at the repots and see what boards are being more frequent, what sizing, which boards are being checked more or pure etc

As I can see in the chart above, they overfold compared to GTO by a lot, but raise as much as GTO (or even more)

Now let's take a look at their reaction vs a X/R:

| Scenario             | **Population folds%** | **GTO folds%** | **Raise population%** | **Raise GTO%** |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **B30 flop vs 4.5x** | 46                    | 48             | 5.5                   | 1              |
| **B30 flop vs 3.5x** | 40                    | 39             | 6.6                   | 2              |

| **B50 flop vs 3.5x** | 41                    | 42             | 8.5                   | 2              |
| **B50 flop vs 2.5x** | 30                    | 34             | 9.8                   | 8              |
| **B70 flop vs 4.5x** | 48                    | 55             | 14                    | 1              |
| **B70 flop vs 3.5x** | 41                    | 47             | 9.7                   | 3              |
| **B70 flop vs 2.5x** | 30                    | 37             | 14                    | 7              |
From this table, they underfold ingeneral, but if they bet big, B70, and we X/R, they under-fold by a lot (30% vs 37% of GTO, and 41% vs 47, 48% vs 55%).  So when population bets big, it means it's stronger.
Also they will be fast playing their hands, look at the 3-bet vs a x/r frequencies vs what GTO does.



Now let's break down those tables to the two populations: 1. nits+fish 2.regs

| **B70 flop**  | 48                    | 41             | 6.5                    | 5               |

So, the fish/nits clearly overfold compared to GTO vs a c-bet, and raise close (or a bit more) to GTO.
Flops which are already bet at a high frequency as sb vs bb SRP like QhTh5d, if villian overfolds then it's best to bet range (that's the solver response).

And again, if they bet big, they under-fold vs GTO, so if they bet big, bluff much less.

OK, now let's take a look at the same data but for the regs only:

The regs noticed that people check a weaker range than they should, so they  bet too much and fold a lot more compared to GTO vs a X/R.  Even the 70% bet will be overfolded, so even in their big bets range, they have too many bluffs and will be overfolding.

So, X/R more as a bluff, but X/C strong hands since they will put the money in for us (but say I have AA, I still want to X/C and not X/R  so I won't isolate myself vs a very strong range).


So overall, again the nits/fish: Overbluff the flop as they overfold, every time they stab and I have a good hand fastplay myself (they don't fold enough), and especially fastplay vs the big bets because this means strength and they will def underfold.
vs the regs slowplay (they lead too weak and they will overbluff on later streets too)

What happens on the turn when the flop when X-X?

So both the fish and the regs will overfold on the turn, so I should overbluff the turn if it went X-X.
