# How to Play SRP OOP

**SRP OOP** = Blind vs Blind and Early Position vs BTN’s Preflop Flat

Because we are now OOP, the high-frequency 1/3 c-bet won’t be as effective as when we were IP. Villain will be able to float too many hands on the flop, and then we don’t really know what to do on the turn.

SRP are really complicated and can be studied for a very long time.
As always, our goal in this video is to simplify our strategy as much as possible so that we can memorize and execute it well.

Let’s first take a look at what GTO does, and then we will study the population tendencies to try to find exploits.

| **B120 flop** | 59                           | 56                       | 5.1               | 3               |
| **B100 flop** | 55                           | 49                       | 8.5               | 4               |
| **B70 flop**  | 47                           | 41                       | 7.1               | 5               |
| **B50 flop**  | 38                           | 30                       | 9.5               | 9               |
| **B30 flop**  | 30                           | 24                       | 13                | 13              |


As I can see in the chart above, they overfold compared to GTO by a lot, but raise as much as GTO.

Now let's take a look at their reaction vs a X/R:

## IP's Response vs Check-Raise  
*(Data from Mobius Poker)*

| Scenario             | **Population folds%** | **GTO folds%** | **Raise population%** | **Raise GTO%** |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **B30 flop vs 4.5x** | 46                    | 48             | 5.5                   | 1              |
| **B30 flop vs 3.5x** | 40                    | 39             | 6.6                   | 2              |
| **B30 flop vs 2.5x** | 27                    | 29             | 10                    | 5              |
| **B50 flop vs 4.5x** | 47                    | 49             | 7.7                   | 0              |
| **B50 flop vs 3.5x** | 41                    | 42             | 8.5                   | 2              |
| **B50 flop vs 2.5x** | 30                    | 34             | 9.8                   | 8              |
| **B70 flop vs 4.5x** | 48                    | 55             | 14                    | 1              |
| **B70 flop vs 3.5x** | 41                    | 47             | 9.7                   | 3              |
| **B70 flop vs 2.5x** | 30                    | 37             | 14                    | 7              |
From this table, if they bet big, B70, and we X/R, they under-fold by a lot (30% vs 37% of GTO, and 41% vs 47, 48% vs 55%).  So when population bets big, it means it's stronger.
Also they will be fast playing their hands, look at the 3-bet vs a x/r frequencies vs what GTO does.



Now let's break down those tables to the two populations: 1. nits+fish 2.regs
## IP's Call % vs C-Bet and Raise % vs GTO — Nits + Fish  
*(Data from Mobius Poker)*

| Scenario      | **Population Call %** | **GTO Call %** | **Population Raise %** | **GTO Raise %** |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| **B120 flop** | 59                    | 56             | 5.3                    | 3               |
| **B100 flop** | 56                    | 49             | 8.4                    | 4               |
| **B70 flop**  | 48                    | 41             | 6.5                    | 5               |
| **B50 flop**  | 38                    | 30             | 8.6                    | 9               |
| **B30 flop**  | 30                    | 24             | 12                     | 13              |

So, the fish/nits clearly overfold compared to GTO, and raise close (or a bit more) to GTO.
Flops which are already bet at a high frequency as sb vs bb SRP like QhTh5d, if villian overfolds then it's best to bet range (that's the solver response).

And again, if they bet big, they under-fold vs GTO, so if they bet big, bluff much less.

OK, now let's take a look at the same data but for the regs only:

The regs noticed that people check a weaker range than they should, so they  bet too much and fold a lot more compared to GTO vs a X/R.
