Before his session, nevir labelled the nits vs the regs,
when he sees the regs on the table yet to act he opens tight, and against the nits open wide

Hand 1:
Nevir is on the sb with Ad4c, a reg with 67% ATS opens from BU, nevir 3-bet him saying this guy has too many shitty hands and won't 4-bet as frequently as he should. Villian folded.

Hand 2:

Nevir opens 9h6h from CO, BB with 25-3-1 (that's right,1% 3-bet) after 1170 hands 3-bets small to 6.5BB, nevir says that villian has KK+ (1% 3-bet) but he will still be calling since the implied odds are good and the playability of the hand,
flop 7h7d8d BB B30, nevir calls saying- I never raise since villian never folds, I just want to realize my equity
Turn Jh B50/C
River Tc BB checks, nevir said - i don't think he will fold, went all in, got called by QQ.

Hand 3:
Co opens, sb calls, Nevir in BB with QsTc folds -"In these spots you should be tight, try to have squeeze or fold strategy, QTo isn't good enough"

Hand 4:
