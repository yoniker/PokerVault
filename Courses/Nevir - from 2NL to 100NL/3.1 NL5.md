NL5 plays exactly like NL2, only that there are slightly more regs. The regs play the same, the fish play the same, just focus on the fish and avoid the regs.

## NL 5 play &explain

Before his session, nevir labelled the nits vs the regs,
when he sees the regs on the table yet to act he opens tight, and against the nits open wide

Hand 1:
Nevir is on the sb with Ad4c, a reg with 67% ATS opens from BU, nevir 3-bet him saying this guy has too many shitty hands and won't 4-bet as frequently as he should. Villian folded.

Hand 2:

Nevir opens 9h6h from CO, BB with 25-3-1 (that's right,1% 3-bet) after 1170 hands 3-bets small to 6.5BB, nevir says that villian has KK+ (1% 3-bet) but he will still be calling since the implied odds are good and the playability of the hand,
flop 7h7d8d BB B30, nevir calls saying- I never raise since villian never folds, I just want to realize my equity
Turn Jh B50/C
River Tc BB checks, nevir said - i don't think he will fold, went all in, got called by QQ.

Hand 3:
Co opens, sb calls, Nevir in BB with QsTc folds -"In these spots you should be tight, try to have squeeze or fold strategy, QTo isn't good enough"

Hand 4:
BU opens, Nevir calls from BB with KcQs
Flop comes JcJd6c, nevir checks and says "I have a good hand to X/R" BU B33, Nevir X/R X3 BU folds "I only want him to folds random stuff to deny equity like QhTh"

Hand 5:
Nevir opens 5d3h on the BU vs two nits.
Flop comes Jd8dTc X/B33/C
Turn Kc, nevir said he will bet the turn and if called the river, because there are many hands he will call turn fold river like J9/98/T9.
