Forget about the 1/3 cbet range, it was probably a mistake on some textures when we were in position, and it's even worse now that we're out of position. Since we're OOP, we'll need to use larger sizings to maximize fold equity, but we'll also need to check at a high frequency.

In the following tables, when it says something like "B30 flop vs. 3.5x" this means, "The in position player Bet 30% pot, and the oop player X/R to 3.5x the IP player bet"

So, the B50 lines is stronger than GTO's range as population folds less,call the same and X/R even more.
Also, population will fast play more than GTO (a lot more raise vs our check/raise compared to GTO) -> I should X/R more polorized, eg, X/R hands that either want to get all the money in, or don't mind X/R and then fold.

|B50 flop vs. 2.5x|38|37|46|47|18|16|
Here as we can see, population will be overfolding by a lot and will fast play a lot more compared to the solver

So, the nits and fish will be overfolding, but the regs will be overfolding even more, as they think we will fast-play our strong hands too much (if I have AA on T75 why would I check), and they will think I have a stronger range when I X/R, wherease I will be bluffing a ton.

In fact, as SB X/R range is actually the solver's preference if they overfold by 10%.
Some people ask, okay, so I X/R range, but what if I get called? Answer is- like in a 3B pot in position, I will give up on some turns, and that's perfectly fine, as the EV I'm making against their mistakes comes from the flop!
