In this section we will learn how to play 3-bet pots in position in theory, and in the next section (2.3) how to exploit.

# How to play 3bet Pots IP in theory

_(You can study postflop theory using GTOwizard but you need a subscription)_

If you have not studied postflop theory, you're probably doing these mistakes in 3bet pots:

- range 1/3 on every texture even OOP

→This is a mistake because you will overfold against raises on the flop (you shouldn't be betting for a small size on many spots)

→Your range on the turn will be weak and you won't be aggressive enough

→You let your opponent realize his equity too easily.

- a second mistake that you probably do is bet big on drawy textures (J98fd) for protection and small on dry textures (T42r)

K-high monotone boards are NOT bet at 100% frequency (about 50% for some boards)


## Why is it a mistake to bet big on drawy board and small on dry board?

The reason why we should actually bet big on dry boards and small on drawy boards is simple and can be found by answering to 2 questions.

1-Am I betting polar or linear? (merged)

2-If I bet big with AA, am I folding out better hands or am I getting value from worse hands?

1-To answer this first question, just visualize your range and ask yourself "Do I have any medium strength hands that still want to bet for value/protection here?"
