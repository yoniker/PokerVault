## NL2 Play & Explain


In this video Nevir will focus on the following exploits:
- Open wider than GTO
- 3-bet tighter + mergier than GTO in most spots
- 3-bet wider than GTO BvB + BB vs BTN
- Overfold against 3-bets
- 2x open from every position


Nevir went through the players first, and took some notes.
For example, he found a guy 3-betting 7% after 300 hands so he tagged him as a nit, and another guy with ATS of 95%, so he opens range from CO/BU/SB -> Nevir will 3-bet range vs this guy
