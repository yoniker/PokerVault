## NL2 Play & Explain


In this video Nevir will focus on the following exploits:
- Open wider than GTO
- 3-bet tighter + mergier than GTO in most spots
- 3-bet wider than GTO BvB + BB vs BTN
- Overfold against 3-bets
- 2x open from every position


Nevir went through the players first, and took some notes.
For example, he found a guy 3-betting 7% after 300 hands so he tagged him as a nit, and another guy with ATS of 95%, so he opens range from CO/BU/SB -> Nevir will 3-bet range vs this guy

Hand 1:
Opened 76o from sb vs a nit BB. Nit snap folded, Nevir said, that's what you're looking for, the snap folds from my opponents, and I'm going to steal the blinds a lot, and this is how I will increase my win rate, but i need labels (nit), I don't want to open wide all the time

Hand 2: 

Opened 73o against a nit bvb, flop came Jh8c5c, he said he will be checking range,and everytime they check back he put pressure. Turn Qc, he bet 3BB into 4BB, BB called. River 8s, Nevir went huge (50BB into 10BB), villian snap folded

Hand 3: 
HJ opens, nevir called with Tc9c
Flop came Ts3s4d, nevir X his opponent bet B33,nevir went x4 for denial/value vs this range bet

Hand 4: 
Limped pot, CO limped, Nevir in BB with 6s2d
flop came Qh7h4h, went X/X, Nevir said that he will apply pressure after villian checks, and on turn 4d, nevir bet 2BB into 2.5BB and villian folded

Hand 5:
Nevir opened QsTs UTG, a nit from BU 3-bet,BB called, Nevir said that this type of hand will be too dominated and folded

Hand 6:
HJ Opens, Nevir with 88 3-bet, sb cold 4-bet Nevir folded
