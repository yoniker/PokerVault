## NL2 Play & Explain


In this video Nevir (the course instructor) will focus on the following exploits:
- Open wider than GTO
- 3-bet tighter + mergier than GTO in most spots
- 3-bet wider than GTO BvB + BB vs BTN
- Overfold against 3-bets
- 2x open from every position


Nevir went through the players first, and took some notes.
For example, he found a guy 3-betting 7% after 300 hands so he tagged him as a nit, and another guy with ATS of 95%, so he opens range from CO/BU/SB -> Nevir will 3-bet range vs this guy

Hand 1:
Opened 76o from sb vs a nit BB. Nit snap folded, Nevir said, that's what you're looking for, the snap folds from my opponents, and I'm going to steal the blinds a lot, and this is how I will increase my win rate, but i need labels (nit), I don't want to open wide all the time

Hand 2: 

Opened 73o against a nit bvb, flop came Jh8c5c, he said he will be checking range,and everytime they check back he put pressure. Turn Qc, he bet 3BB into 4BB, BB called. River 8s, Nevir went huge (50BB into 10BB), villian snap folded

Hand 3: 
HJ opens, nevir called with Tc9c
Flop came Ts3s4d, nevir X his opponent bet B33,nevir went x4 for denial/value vs this range bet

Hand 4: 
Limped pot, CO limped, Nevir in BB with 6s2d
flop came Qh7h4h, went X/X, Nevir said that he will apply pressure after villian checks, and on turn 4d, nevir bet 2BB into 2.5BB and villian folded

Hand 5:
Nevir opened QsTs UTG, a nit from BU 3-bet,BB called, Nevir said that this type of hand will be too dominated and folded

Hand 6:
HJ Opens, Nevir with 88 3-bet, sb cold 4-bet Nevir folded

Hand 7:
 KdJd as LJ vs BU. BU is a whale and plays 74% of hands.
 Flop As6d4d went X/B50/C. Nevir said that he's good here most of the time as the whale has many shitty hands.

Hand 8:
Nevir 3-bet as sb vs LJ, LJ calls.
Flop 5hTc3d X/X (nevir intended to X/R)
Turn Ac B100/C
River 3c,
Nevir said that now he can't jam. He block bet 15BB into 69BB, villian shoved, Nevir folded:
"Think about it, what does he have when he calls. He has top pair which are never shoving river, he has flush draws, so it's a really easy fold, he's never going to jam worse here"

Hand 9:
vs a BU with 43% ATS, Nevir 3-bet J9s as sb vs BU

Hand 10:

Nevir 3-bet KQo as SB vs BU.
Flop comes Kd7s5s B33/C, Turn 3h B66/C river Tc ,Nevir went all in(!!).
"You shouldn't be scared to value bet" - got a call by JJ.

Hand 11:

Nevir opens K4s from LJ - shouldn't be an open at equilibrium, but we open wider than GTO in every position


Hand 12: Nevir opened QhTc from LJ, sb calls BB calls.
Flop comes 9s3d2h, x/x/nevir B33, only BB calls.
Turn 4h X/Nevir checked, saying that villian will have so many pair+gutshot/straight/two pair that he's not going to bet
River 6h X/? Nevir said that now that villian checked,does villian have a flush? Nope. Can he have a straight? maybe he could but ....and bet 5x pot (50 BBs into 10BBs),and villian snap folded

Hand 13:
Nevir opened 6d5d as HJ and got 3-bet by a nit. He called saying it's a good hand to flat vs nits.
Flop comes 9d5h2s, he checked intending to either check/call or check/raise, he said he would check/raise more vs B33 as people bet based on their holdings (if he has QQ he would be big, if he has AK he would bet small). Villian bet B33, nevir X/R x3, villian called.
Turn came 3s, Nevir said that he will bet again because villian can still call worse (AK/AQ) and bet B33, villian jammed and he just folded.

Hand 14:
Splashpot (10BB), Nevir has 55 in the BB, his thought process is that since the actual BB is not 10BB, from a stack of 100BB he is now playing 10BBs deep so jamming with 55 when 10BB deep is good.

Hand 15:
Nevir opens QsQd from HJ, BB calls.
Flop comes 9s5s2d, X/B33/ villian XR to x3 by a nit. Nevir flats saying that he can still be ahead but it's concerning. Turn 7h, The nit bets 15BB into 19.5BB pot, Nevir said that he will call the turn, but if villian bets the river he's folding. River came 4s, villian checked, Nevir checked back, villian showed 6c6h (so nevir's preception of the player being a nit was wrong)

Hand 16:
Nevir opens 5s5d from LJ, sb calls BB calls.
Flop comes 6c2dKc, X/X/ Nevir B33, only sb calls.
Turn 7d X/X
River Th villian bets 9BB into the 9BB pot.
Nevir called, the guy has KdJh, he called because he saw that guy doing crazy stuff in the past and he has a tag.

Hand 17:
Nevir opens AhTh from CO, BU calls.
Flop comes 5hTd2s  nevir X (intending to either x/r or x/c of course), villian x back.
Turn Ts, nevir said that once villian checks back turn he most likely has some A-high, so he targeted the weaker portion of villian, B33/C
River 6d Nevir bet 4.5bB into 9.5BB, villian raised to 18.5BB. Nevir only called saying that villian cna have sth like 66. Villian has 55 for the full house (he flopped a set and checked back). Nevir took a note - that this villian can check back traps.

Hand 18:
sb opened to 4BB, nevir with AdJs called from bb.
Flop comes JcTs5s, villian bet 3BB into 8BB, Nevir raised to 10BB, villian called.
Turn 8d X/ nevir bet 21BB into 28BB, villian folded

Hand 19: 

CO opens to 2.5BB, nevir has a label on his as someone who opens too wide from late and 3-bet him with 8d6d. He explained that this hand has playability postflop, and so he prefers 3-betting this hand over A8o.

Hand 20:

Nevir with Ac4h folded from CO because the table is fishy and so they can call a lot of domintaing hands like A8o.

Hand 21:

BU opens to 2BB, Nevir with AdTs looked at villian's ATS, it was only 20, so therefore Nevir didn't 3-bet and just folded (villian opens too tight from late positions)

Hand 22:

CO opens
Nevir has Qh8h from BU, CO opens to 3BB, and Nevir actually 3-bet him, since the guy is bad and he can call worse vs a 3-bet.

Hand 23:

BU with 44% ATS opens the BU, Nevir 3-bet with KcJh. He said that he would prefer to have J9s because they call too much and don't 4-bet enough, but KJo is okay to 3-bet.
Flop comes 6d4dAd X/X.
Turn 3d Nevir bet 8BB into 23BB ('i don't know whats the best move here'), BU calls.
River Kd, Nevir said that with a d villian will never fold and checked, villian checked back, chopped vs AsQs

Hand 24:
Nevir opened AcTd from BU, sb calls. 
Flop comes 2h4h9s, sb checked, Nevir said that it's okay to start bluffing with this hand, villian would have to fold stuff like KQo (which is good because it has equity against our hand so we deny equity) and call worse like As5s

Hand 25: 
Nevir opened 5h4c from BU, BB calls.
Flop comes 6d3hAd, X/nevir bet B33/C
Turn 8s, X/ Nevir overbet, villian folds

Hand 26:

Nevir opens AcAs from LJ, HJ calls.
Flop comes Qc2s3h, he checks, villian bets 3BB into 5.5BB, Nevir X/R to 12BB saying "It's a bit scary to be honest, because when I X/R 250BB deep it might become a tough spot".
turn comes Jc, Nevir bets 22.5BBs saying "i would like to see a 2 or a 3 on the river",villian folded

Hand 27:
Nevir opened 8h6c from BU as there are two nits in SB and BB. BB calls.
Flop comes AcJh2c X/B30 and villian called, pot is 7.5BB.
Turn Kd, went X/X  
Turn 7d villian bet 6BB into 7.5 Nevir said "if he checked or bluffed small i would have bluffed but actually because he folds so much on the flop, I can just not keep betting because he folds so much on the flop"

Hand 28:
HJ with a 53% VPIP opens , Nevir from CO with Jh9h 3-bet him "This guy is a fish I'm going to try to play against him", villian folded

Hand 29:
AdKh Nevir opens from LJ, BB calls.
Flop comes 3s2s2c, BB checks Nevir bets B33 for value/protection, explaining that BB should X/R hands like 6c4c but they won't, so they don't X/R enough. Turn Js X/X River 9c BB snap bets 6BB into 7.5BB, nevir calls! He said that villian isn't going to bet 55 like this, he can have 54/65. Villian showed QcTh

Hand 30:
Nevir opens AhKd from LJ,  CO with effective stack of 205BB min-3bets to 3BB, nevir 4-bets to 15BBs, saying that he's still going to 4-bet but this deep we need to care. 

Flop comes As3hKh, Nevir bets 8BB into 31.5, CO folds
