## NL2 Play & Explain


In this video Nevir will focus on the following exploits:
- Open wider than GTO
- 3-bet tighter + mergier than GTO in most spots
- 3-bet wider than GTO BvB + BB vs BTN
- Overfold against 3-bets
- 2x open from every position


Nevir went through the players first, and took some notes.
For example, he found a guy 3-betting 7% after 300 hands so he tagged him as a nit, and another guy with ATS of 95%, so he opens range from CO/BU/SB -> Nevir will 3-bet range vs this guy

Hand 1:
Opened 76o from sb vs a nit BB. Nit snap folded, Nevir said, that's what you're looking for, the snap folds from my opponents, and I'm going to steal the blinds a lot, and this is how I will increase my win rate, but i need labels (nit), I don't want to open wide all the time

Hand 2: 

Opened 73o against a nit bvb, flop came Jh8c5c, he said he will be checking range,and everytime they check back he put pressure. Turn Qc, he bet 3BB into 4BB, BB called. River 8s, Nevir went huge (50BB into 10BB), villian snap folded

Hand 3: 
HJ opens, nevir called with Tc9c
Flop came Ts3s4d, nevir X his opponent bet B33,nevir went x4 for denial/value vs this range bet

Hand 4: 
Limped pot, CO limped, Nevir in BB with 6s2d
flop came Qh7h4h, went X/X, Nevir said that he will apply pressure after villian checks, and on turn 4d, nevir bet 2BB into 2.5BB and villian folded

Hand 5:
Nevir opened QsTs UTG, a nit from BU 3-bet,BB called, Nevir said that this type of hand will be too dominated and folded

Hand 6:
HJ Opens, Nevir with 88 3-bet, sb cold 4-bet Nevir folded

Hand 7:
 KdJd as LJ vs BU. BU is a whale and plays 74% of hands.
 Flop As6d4d went X/B50/C. Nevir said that he's good here most of the time as the whale has many shitty hands.

Hand 8:
Nevir 3-bet as sb vs LJ, LJ calls.
Flop 5hTc3d X/X (nevir intended to X/R)
Turn Ac B100/C
River 3c,
Nevir said that now he can't jam. He block bet 15BB into 69BB, villian shoved, Nevir folded:
"Think about it, what does he have when he calls. He has top pair which are never shoving river, he has flush draws, so it's a really easy fold, he's never going to jam worse here"

Hand 9:
vs a BU with 43% ATS, Nevir 3-bet J9s as sb vs BU

Hand 10:

Nevir 3-bet KQo as SB vs BU.
Flop comes Kd7s5s B33/C, Turn 3h B66/C river Tc ,Nevir went all in(!!).
"You shouldn't be scared to value bet" - got a call by JJ.

Hand 11:

Nevir opens K4s from LJ - shouldn't be an open at equilibrium, but we open wider than GTO in every position

Where I am: 9:50
