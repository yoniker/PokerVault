**SRP 100bb deep** is the most complex part of the game, as ranges are wide and we have a lot of chips behind to play with. Therefore, we need to find ways to simplify our strategy as much as possible.

## Simplification makes more money

As you can see, the theoretical strategy might not always be the most profitable in practice, as it can be too complex to execute accurately. Additionally, our opponents might make even bigger mistakes against simpler, more practical strategies.

## What is your goal when it comes to choosing a sizing?

Your goal should be to find **one sizing per flop** and execute that strategy well. Don’t try to memorize every single spot — instead, focus on visualizing what your sizing accomplishes:

- What type of hands will continue against my bet?
    
- What type of hands will fold?
    
- With my exact hand, what hands do I want him to continue / fold with?
    
- Considering the hands that will continue, which turns will I bluff / give up?
    

Also, I think simplifying to **3 main sizings** — small / medium / big (like 1/3, 1/2, 3/4) — is more than good enough. I don’t think having sizings like **253%** or **116%** overbets is necessary, especially IP.
