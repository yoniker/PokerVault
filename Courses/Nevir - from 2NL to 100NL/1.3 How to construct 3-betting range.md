Overall 3-bet frequency in NL50 R&C is 8.4% , GTO is 10.6% => they 3-bet in general about 20.75% less than GTO. 

| GTO-3bet | SB    | BU    | CO    | HJ    | UTG  |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| BB       | 17.2% | 14.2% | 9.8%  | 7.2%  | 5.6% |
| SB       | X     | 15.1% | 11.2% | 9.2%  | 8%   |
| BU       | X     | X     | 14.1% | 11.7% | 9.8% |
| CO       | X     | X     | X     | 10.9% | 9.6% |
| HJ       | X     | X     | X     | X     | 9%   |
And now this is the population's 3-bet 

| NL50 | SB  | BU  | CO  | HJ   | UTG  |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| BB   | X   | 13% | 9%  | 6.3% | 4.7% |
| SB   | X   | X   | 11% | 8.7% | 6.4% |
| BU   | X   | X   | X   | 11%  | 8.3% |
| CO   | X   | X   | X   | X    | 8.1% |
| HJ   | X   | X   | X   | X    | 7.1% |
All across the board, they 3-bet much less than GTO (20-30% less per position).
I can use GTOW to learn GTO ranges, and Hand2note to have my own stats (as well as population's stats).

If I hadn't studied/implementing GTO-ranges, there's a high chance I'm playing too tight.
But, is it actually a mistake? We will discuss that in this chapter.

Factors that affect my 3-bet strategy:
1. Is my opponent opening wider or tighter than GTO? Wider=I can 3-bet more
2. Is my opponent 4-betting enough or rarely? If they don't 4-bet enough, I can get away with more bluffs
3. Is my opponent calling 3-bets often or folding too much?
4. Will I be in position or out of position?

Those are the population's open stats vs GTO:

| Open raise frequencies | UTG   | HJ  | CO  | BU    | SB    | Overall |
| ---------------------- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| GTO                    | 19.5% | 24% | 30% | 42.5% | 43.5% | 31.9%   |
| NL2                    | 18%   | 20% | 24% | 35%   | 35%   | 26.4%   |
| NL50                   | 19%   | 21% | 26% | 38%   | 39%   | 28.6%   |
Since they open a tighter range than GTO (especially from BU and SB), I have less fold equity against them

Now let's look at their response vs a 3bet:

| vs 3bet | Call   | Fold   | 4-bet  |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| GTO     | 19.8%  | 62.7%  | 17.5%  |
| NL50    | 34.5%  | 51%    | 14.5%  |
| NL2     | 32.75% | 53.25% | 14.25% |
And here are the GTO & NL50 stats per position vs a 3B:
Start with GTO's response (call % /fold %/ 4bet %)

| GTO | SB       | BU       | CO       | UTG  |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---- |
| BB  | 20/60/20 | 33/55/12 | 33/57/10 | 4.7% |
| SB  | X        | X        | 11%      | 6.4% |
| BU  | X        | X        | X        | 8.3% |
| CO  | X        | X        | X        | 8.1% |
| HJ  | X        | X        | X        | 7.1% |


And now this is the population's response to a 3-bet by position:

| NL50 | SB       | BU       | CO       | UTG  |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---- |
| BB   | 27/58/15 | 29/61/10 | 36/53/11 | 4.7% |
| SB   | X        | X        | 11%      | 6.4% |
| BU   | X        | X        | X        | 8.3% |
| CO   | X        | X        | X        | 8.1% |
| HJ   | X        | X        | X        | 7.1% |
All across the board, they 3-bet much less than GTO (20-30% less per position), so I shouldn't continue vs their range like GTO does continue against GTO, but continue tighter.
