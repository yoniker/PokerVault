There's an opening range in GTOW, why would I change my opening range?

If I didn't study GTO yet, chances are that I'm opening too tight (NL50 population opens too tight everything but UTG). Small adjustments matter: If I manage to steal the blinds just 2 more times in 100 hands vs nits in the blinds, that's a gain of +3BB/100 already - a small change with a big payoff.

### Why frequencies matter
Knowing GTO frequencies helps me identify when players deviate - whether they are too tight or too loose compared to GTO => to exploit the field effectively, I need to know what GTO looks like, only then I can spot and punish deviations.

### What affects my opening frequency
Let's take BU as an example. I need to consider:
1. sb's 3-bet frequency vs GTO
2. Does sb have a flatting range?
3. is BB 3-betting more or less compared to GTO?
4. Is BB defending more or less compared to GTO?

Population data at NL50-ggpoker:

| SB vs BU | 3-bet | Call | Fold  |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| GTO      | 15.1% | 0%   | 84.9% |
| NL50     | 11%   | 9.5% | 79.5% |

I have to figure out how to deviate, because the strategy of GTOW is designed against the GTO sb and GTO BB's strategies, and so isn't optimal vs those ranges

| BB vs BTN | 3-bet | Call  | Fold  |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GTO       | 14.2% | 29.7% | 56.1% |
| NL50      | 9%    | 30%   | 61%   |
The adjustment for those players- BU should be opening 70% of his hands.

Overall 3-bet frequency in NL50 R&C is 8.4% , GTO is 10.6% => they 3-bet in general about 20.75% less than GTO. Therefore, I can open wider from any position.
