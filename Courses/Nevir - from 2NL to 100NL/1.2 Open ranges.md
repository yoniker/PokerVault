There's an opening range in GTOW, why would I change my opening range?

If I didn't study GTO yet, chances are that I'm opening too tight (NL50 population opens too tight everything but UTG). Small adjustments matter: If I manage to steal the blinds just 2 more times in 100 hands vs nits in the blinds, that's a gain of +3BB/100 already - a small change with a big payoff.

### Why frequencies matter
Knowing GTO frequencies helps me identify when players deviate - whether they are too tight or too loose compared to GTO => to exploit the field effectively, I need to know what GTO looks like, only then I can spot and punish deviations.

### What affects my opening frequency
Let's take BU as an example. I need to consider:
1. sb's 3-bet frequency vs GTO
2. Does sb have a flatting range?
3. is BB 3-betting more or less compared to GTO?
4. Is BB defending more or less compared to GTO?

Population data at NL50-ggpoker:

| SB vs BU | 3-bet | Call | Fold  |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| GTO      | 15.1% | 0%   | 84.9% |
| NL50     | 11%   | 9.5% | 79.5% |

I have to figure out how to deviate, because the strategy of GTOW is designed against the GTO sb and GTO BB's strategies, and so isn't optimal vs those ranges

| BB vs BTN | 3-bet | Call  | Fold  |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GTO       | 14.2% | 29.7% | 56.1% |
| NL50      | 9%    | 30%   | 61%   |
The adjustment for those players- BU should be opening 70% of his hands.

Overall 3-bet frequency in NL50 R&C is 8.4% , GTO is 10.6% => they 3-bet in general about 20.75% less than GTO. Therefore, I can open wider from any position.

| GTO-3bet | SB    | BU    | CO    | HJ    | UTG  |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| BB       | 17.2% | 14.2% | 9.8%  | 7.2%  | 5.6% |
| SB       | X     | 15.1% | 11.2% | 9.2%  | 8%   |
| BU       | X     | X     | 14.1% | 11.7% | 9.8% |
| CO       | X     | X     | X     | 10.9% | 9.6% |
| HJ       | X     | X     | X     | X     | 9%   |
And now this is the population's 3-bet 

| NL50 | SB  | BU  | CO  | HJ   | UTG  |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| BB   | X   | 13% | 9%  | 6.3% | 4.7% |
| SB   | X   | X   | 11% | 8.7% | 6.4% |
| BU   | X   | X   | X   | 11%  | 8.3% |
| CO   | X   | X   | X   | X    | 8.1% |
| HJ   | X   | X   | X   | X    | 7.1% |
All across the board, they 3-bet much less than GTO (20-30% less per position), so I shouldn't continue vs their range like GTO does continue against GTO, but continue tighter.

| BB's defense | SB    | BU    | CO    | HJ/LJ |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GTO          | 41.3% | 29.4% | 30.4% | 40.5% |
| NL50         | 33%   | 30%   | 31%   | 32%   |

Also, BB defend much tighter in the games (in relation to how much GTO defends) so I should open wider. 


Which open-raise size should I use?

|                          | 2BB-BU | 2BB-SB |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| BB's fold frequency-GTO  | 32%    | 14%    |
| BB's fold frequency-NL50 | 50.5%  | 38%    |


Actually, the true max-exploit for sb opening 2bb is to open 100% of the hands (and when opening 3BB open about 91% of the range).
