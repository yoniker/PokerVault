# But how should you play the turn once you get called?

Since villain doesn't XR enough and we cbet range OTF, our equity decreases a lot because he already folded all his trash hands, while we still have 100% of our range.

This means 3 things in theory:

1. **Villain should have a lot of donks OTT (especially on low cards) to punish us for range betting OTF.**
    
    ○ In practice, population doesn't donk much, which is good for us.
    
    ○ We can comfortably range bet OTF without worrying about facing donks OTT.
    
2. **We should now use polarized bets OTT.**
    
    ○ Yes, our equity has decreased, but we still have the overpairs advantage.
    
    ○ That's why, after range betting OTF, we mostly use big bets OTT.
    
3. **We should do a lot of XB OTT.**
    
    ○ Villain already made big mistakes OTF by not XR or calling enough, meaning most of our EV came from the flop.
    
    ○ Once he calls, he likely has a decent hand, and bluffing into a stronger range might not be the best idea.
    
    ○ We made our money OTF, so now we can XB OTT and realize our equity.

This is what happens in theory OTT after range betting OTF.

But in practice, population almost never donks OTT and still overfolds to second barrels. So, you can continue applying pressure with your value hands and selected bluffs.
