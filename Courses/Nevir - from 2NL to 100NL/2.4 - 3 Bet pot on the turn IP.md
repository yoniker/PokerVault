# But how should you play the turn once you get called?

Since villain doesn't XR enough and we cbet range OTF, our equity decreases a lot because he already folded all his trash hands, while we still have 100% of our range.

This means 3 things in theory:

1. **Villain should have a lot of donks OTT (especially on low cards) to punish us for range betting OTF.**
    
    ○ In practice, population doesn't donk much, which is good for us.
    
    ○ We can comfortably range bet OTF without worrying about facing donks OTT.
    
2. **We should now use polarized bets OTT.**
    
    ○ Yes, our equity has decreased, but we still have the overpairs advantage.
    
    ○ That's why, after range betting OTF, we mostly use big bets OTT.
    
3. **We should do a lot of XB OTT.**
    
    ○ Villain already made big mistakes OTF by not XR or calling enough, meaning most of our EV came from the flop.
    
    ○ Once he calls, he likely has a decent hand, and bluffing into a stronger range might not be the best idea.
    
    ○ We made our money OTF, so now we can XB OTT and realize our equity.

This is what happens in theory OTT after range betting OTF.

But in practice, population almost never donks OTT and still overfolds to second barrels. So, you can continue applying pressure with your value hands and selected bluffs.

As you can see, the population overfolds by a lot against 1/3 OTF, 3/4 OTT.
# When we high frequency 1/3 OTF 🔷

- **High frequency 3/4 - 100% POT on all bricks 🧱** →KT5r 2r / QT5fd 2r / A72r 2r
- **Low-medium frequency 40% POT - 2/3 on cards that complete FDs or SDs 💧** KT5fd 2f / JT2r 9r  

Why? Because I bet my entire range OTF, but villian will fold a lot of hand-> He will have way more often flush combos than me (higher concentration as he condensed his range and I didn't)
- **High frequency XB on game-changing turns better for our opponent**  Exploit the fact they don't donk enough to realize your equity →JT7fd 8fd / A54fd 6f

# When we high frequency 2/3 OTF 🔶

- **High frequency 40%-2/3 on overcards 📋** _They call too many PPs but overfold vs overcards._ →962r Jr
- **Medium frequency 40%-2/3 on bricks** →962r 2r
- **High frequency XB on low cards that improve villain's range ⚠️** _Take advantage of underused turn donks._ →962r 7fd


To summarize, a lot of my EV is made from population OTF because they make really big mistakes OTF. 

While I can still exploit them on turns and rivers (they still overfold a lot), I should have a high frequency XB on the turn in some cases (bet big on the flop, a card that favors their range etc)
