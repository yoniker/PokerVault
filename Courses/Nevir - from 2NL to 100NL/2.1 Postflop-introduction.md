# Introduction to POSTFLOP

## What's our goal when studying POSTFLOP?

Our goal when studying postflop is to simplify our strategy as much as possible so that it is easy to remember and execute. We will therefore determine the theoretically optimal single sizing for each type of board. We will aim to simplify both the frequencies and the combo selection for each action.

## People's biggest mistakes when studying GTO:

- they want to memorize all the frequencies and combos in any spots whereas you should always try to have an overall idea of what you should do and find heuristics.
- they only focus on their own strategy whereas we should always focus on our opponent's strategy.
