My summary:
Think how both ranges conenct with the turn card. For example if OOP folds a lot of his Ax and turn is Ax I want to barrel a lot. On a Tx/3x/flush completers I check more.
I slowplay more when the nuts are more static.
Future bluffs - hands that will make "fake" nuts on a flush complete or straight draw completion.
Low equity draws- can bet too to balance my range.

# Turn Barreling Strategy - Q♠T♦3♦ Flop

## Core Concepts

### Flop Action Setup

"In this video, I'm going to go over our first practical example and I'm going to use the board queen ten three with a flush draw. We're going to be focusing on turn barreling but we always need to start with the flop play just to get an idea of the ranges."

"This is your in position button range. I don't worry too much about all these mixed strategies. They're not going to affect any of the concepts or the strategies, it's the ranges I've used. So in position's betting the entire opening range."

"Versus this bet out of position plays this strategy. You see the nutted hands are mostly raising in queen ten, pocket threes, and ten three. There's some trapping with queen three, but this is all but irrelevant. We then see the top pairs are mostly calling, second pairs are pretty much always calling as well as bottom pairs, which can mix raise and the middling pocket pairs which are calling."

### Turn Categories Overview

"What we're focusing on is the turn play here and I just want to think about what the different types of turns can be. First of all, we have bricks, in this case, that is cards two, four, through seven. Bricks are cards with no draws completing and they don't have a major interaction with the range."

## Brick Turns (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 - not spades)

### Strategic Framework

"Two main points we're gonna think about are equity, so how well does it improve each range and nut advantage? On a brick out of position has folded most of their air on the flop, whereas in position has all of theirs. When that happens, it's generally going to be a quite low equity card for in position. That's because they just have so much air going to the turn that they've just got the weaker range overall."

"Now that being said, the nut advantage is in favor of in position. On the flop, we carried our advantage over from preflop with the aces, kings, and ace queen which out of position won't have, but also out of positions raised a lot of their nutted hands on the flop. On bricks, we have low equity but nut advantage and when these two points are met, you almost always play a heavy overbet strategy."

### Betting Range Structure

"As we talked about in the previous video, the first category which bets is value hands. I like using the Range Explorer, it's just a nice way to isolate parts of the range."

"First of all, we see sets, there's no trapping here. Trappings reserved for textures where your range can't improve to beat the current nuts. This is generally on a board like a flush completer where we never check back a flush."

"On bricks there's really no trapping that goes on, even overpairs pure bet and our best top pairs virtually always bet. Top pairs where we start to need to think about where the threshold is for value betting and the kind of good trick is just you want to consider the best top pair out of position can have and in this case, that's some king queen and all queen jack. So if your top pair is equal in strength to that you can usually just pure overbet it."

### Value Bluffing Concept

"Okay, this is another concept I don't really want to go too in-depth on this is I call it value bluffing. So the five x on the turn, when we overbet out of positions going to fold a bunch of better pairs but they'll continue to call with hands like king jack, ace jack, and three x in spades as well as some other flush draws. So it's a value bluff because you get some value from hands like these draws, but you also fold out hands like sixes, seven, eights which beat you as well as some ten x."

"The reason I said I don't tend to recommend it is it's somewhat hard to identify in game, so I would describe it as high-hanging fruit."

### Drawing Hands on Bricks

"First I'll go through the draws and we talked about a few concepts. I'm just going to combine no pair and combo draw. So we see combo draws are our highest equity flush draws. They always barrel."

"There's a few patterns here. King eight is a bit of a strange one, ace nine and ace eight. These just have some showdown value so they'll check back turn, and hope to check down and win. Once we get below the flush draws with some showdown value, however, we tend to bet our best ones most."

"This is the solver's way of protecting the check range with some flush draws but still barreling a lot as a semi-bluff."

### Future Bluffs

"Finally, we'll look at the no-draw hands, and here's where we'll see most of our future bluffs. We see the king six, king four, king two all barreling really quite often. These have the future bluff for the king jack. So on an ace river and a nine river you block the main straights in their ranges so you've got a really good bluff there."

"This is not necessarily because you block straights on the river that is effective but also you make it much harder for your opponent to hero call you because they can't just call with a straight blocker knowing you never bluff with those cards."

## Overcard Turns

### Ace Turn (A♥)

"Ace and king in this case these are also straight completers, but when we consider the flop ranges. Out of positions folding a lot of their ace highs and king highs on the flop, this means we'll have kind of a linear advantage in top pairs."

"I think the nutted combos become more symmetric so I'll say linear advantage top pair, nuts symmetric."

"Yeah, so we see the ace is the best card in the deck for in position and that's because of all these top pairs which we make, which out of position often folds on the flop. The overall strategy we want to play is a smaller barrel for the most part and quite high frequency."

"Alright, so we have a 60% barrel which is pretty crazy and we'll just go through the value hands again, starting with the straights we see some trapping sneaking in. Now this has to do with the concept I described earlier where the nuts are more symmetric so we do want to protect our check range a little bit more."

### Value Betting Ace Turn

"Next, we have top pairs and these are barreling extremely aggressively too. When in position barrels this just 70% size, the out of position player will have to continue quite wide with I would guess most of their queen x and even some ten x."

"You get quite a bit of value from your ace x when you just barrel and get called by these weak bluff catchers. Also, you actually don't mind them folding, they have five outs to beat you for the most part."

"If we just consider we checked back an ace on the turn, most of the out of position range is queen x, ten x, and then some three x. None of these hands want to bet themselves on the river so you really got the onus to put the money in yourself against those hands and just going ahead and betting turn seems to make more sense at least to me."

### Surprising Barrels on Ace Turn

"Kings is even good enough to barrel here. This is, I mean it looks kind of strange to barrel pocket kings on this sort of texture. I think once you borrow down a bit, kind of makes sense. Out of position doesn't have too many ace x in their range just because a lot of the flop floats come from lower cards that had gut shots."

"On these really favorable turns you need to be careful not to have a too high equity barreling range. The solver likes just adding some polarity to the range by betting some weak two undercards. It's kind of gangster too so it's kind of cool."

## Lower Straight Completers

### Nine Turn (9♣)

"There's also lower straight completers. I won't go as in-depth on these but I think some of the concepts for the most part apply. There's a king nine and eight when you think about what overall strategy makes sense."

"The nuts are against symmetric, which is pretty bad for the in position player. In this case, we don't have a linear advantage."

"That really interacts well with a lot of the offsuit part of both ranges, which makes up the biggest part of the strategy. I think just a pot-sized bet makes sense on them. It's kind of saying we're not going to be too linear but we also don't really want to overbet when both players have lots of two pairs and straights."

"Pot size bet strategy seems pretty solid on these lower straight completers where we don't have a linear advantage and the nuts are symmetric."

"Again we see these one card straight draws just being amazing barrels. They remove all the pair plus draw which calls and block less of the folds too."

## Flush Completer (6♦)

"Flush completer, they're usually really quite complex. Out of position raises a lot of their flush draws on the flop but in positions range is wider, so the flushes are generally kind of neutral."

"The general rule I use is just barrel a 70% strategy and it's shaped somewhat similarly to the overall strategy we're playing when it wasn't a flush completer."

"The most important concept on flush completers I think is to check back plenty of flushes and this is again because there's flushes in both ranges, so you want to keep some in the check range too. This is I think even more important on flush completers because there's not really any hands which can catch up to a flush. So you just need to directly trap rather than check a range which can improve on rivers."

"I tend to use it quarter of the time I think is what I recall, but and check a sim. Yeah, it looks like a quarter of the time it's kind of bang on."

### Value Threshold on Flush Completers

"So yeah, trappings important one-card flush draws are pretty good to barrel but they also make sense to check."

"Definitely, an area where you can find some nuance but I think the key points make sure you trap enough so there's going to be 70 barrel. Make sure you trap enough and don't be too polar."

"What I mean by this is hands like pocket kings are still just good enough to barrel. It's only like queen jack, which needs a bit of protection, barrels quite often too. Even as weak as queen nine still just barrels so you don't want to polarize too much on the flush completers, it's quite easy to do."

"I'll say that the value of your draws shifts down as well. We're looking at a hand like an eight-out straight draw. I think these play more like gut shots do on nonflush completers or gut shots play more like air except eight seven, which seems to be a magic hand."

## Board Pairing Turns

"Finally, we just have pairing turns. If we think about the flop ranges, again, the out of position range is just very paired, so that means pairing turns are really terrible for in position."

"That's because there's a bunch of trips that get made on the pairing turn for both players so it kind of neutralizes our nut advantage. Also none of the air for in position improves. So it's just a very low equity card."

"Very low equity, nuts are more symmetric until we look at the very top of the ranges where in position has more boats on pairing turns you just want to play quite low-frequency bets, I'm pretty sure."

"Make sure you trap a lot. Again, because out of position has some nutted hands."

"There's actually a lot of the similar principles, don't be too polar, hands like queen jack can still barrel some of the time. I think another idea is that flush draws barrel less."

"The idea that flush draws should barrel less is because their draw is less clean. When there's a pair on the board there's going to be full houses in the ranges, so flushes are going to be worth less overall."

"In general, draws go down in value blocks to ten x go up in value, I would say, very low equity nuts are more symmetric. So we need to play a pretty defensive style."

## Key Takeaways

### Turn Strategy Summary

"Now we can look at the comparison across runouts and we've really covered them all. We know that the bricks we like playing an overbet strategy. That's because these are low equity. They're low equity, but we have the nut advantage still so we play lots of overbets."

"On the straight completers eight, nine, and jack, we like barreling a pot-size strategy. That's because the nuts and more symmetric and there's a lot of the out of position continue range has just connected."

"You need to play more polarized than on these high straight completers where we have a linear advantage at the top of the ranges."

"On the board pairing turns, these are the lowest equity turns. We see queen ten and three are the three lowest equity turns for in position. We will need to play quite defensive on these turns and apply concepts to do with symmetric nuts like trapping."

"On the flush completers, we see almost all of them are just playing a medium bet."

"Hope that covers things for turn barreling on this sort of double Broadway texture, and be back for another example."
