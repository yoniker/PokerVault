My summary:
When he dives deep, a pattern I can see is that he's thinking about different turns, overall strategy and how the ranges connect with those cards (if symmerical situation bet small etc).
For example, what happens on a low brick(3/4/5)?
Then, on an overcard, there are straight completers like QJ, and other overcards like A/K.
Then there's pairing the board.
Then there's middling card like 9/7/6(lower straight completers).


He thinks about the general strategy for each card (what's the best sizing? around which value? what each handclass does?), and only then goes ahead and looks at the solver's solution, and sees how his current heuristics match with what the solver actually does.
# Turn Barreling Strategy - T♣8♦2♠ Rainbow

## Core Concepts

### Range Betting Decision

"In this video, I'm going to take a look at a bit of a lower board, in ten eight two rainbow and I'll start by looking at the spreadsheet a bit. In the past I played ten high boards as a bit of a bigger bet, kinda often I kind of autopilot and make mistakes in the checking lines. I've decided I probably want to start range betting these too."

"We can see here, I've highlighted the disconnected ones and the ten high boards are really quite reasonable to play a range bet on."

### Out of Position Defense

"First of all, if we think about facing the small bet, I think the defense will actually be quite natural for out of position. A lot of these hands are just pretty clear calls. I would say. Any two overcards is pretty clear and all the gut shots."

"The solver is taking a lot of pretty weak backdoor hands though. I wouldn't be surprised if it is a bit overfolded particularly in this region. Hands like queen seven, although I do think a lot of people will find these check raises."

### Range Composition

"So if we consider this range, there's a decent amount of over-cards that will tend to have advantages based around these folds here. Then the range is again very paired, pretty decent weighting of over-cards but not as many as in position, and lots of straight draws."

## Brick Turns (3, 4, 5)

### Strategic Framework

"The first turn I'll look at is a low brick. I think these will be the clearest in my mind at least. I'll just call it a brick. There's not really high bricks in this example, so brick is going to be a card between three and five and this will be our classic overbet spot I think."

"The turn doesn't really interact with the air in either ranges, so the in position will have the lower equity range, but a nut advantage. So lower equity and nut advantage leads to overbets. I expect to see a 130 or check strategy and yeah, we do."

### Value Range Structure

"Again, we see there's not really trapping. Same principles as the other videos. We've still got a pretty big nut advantage in our checking range. Can still improve across rivers without finding traps so we don't really check. Even good top pairs are mostly betting."

### Protection Dynamics

"This little situation is based around the top pairs which need more protection. Ten nine really likes getting folds from the jack and queen hands because they have outs to top pair against it. So solver likes barreling more with the top pairs which need more protection, which is what's happening here."

### Drawing Hands

"Combo draws mostly betting. We do see some checks from these lower ones. This has the alone nuts. I need to come up with a good name for it. The concept where if we check and hit our straight on the river? We're the only one who can have it so we like keeping those alone nuts."

"Eight out straight draws, again they're just mixing, betting pretty often. In this case, the equities of straight draws are a little different and that's because overcards are more relevant. So if we look at the equities, a hand like queen jack actually has very similar equity to jack nine and has a higher equity draw than hands like nine seven and seven six which are the open-ended straight draws."

### Cleaning Outs Concept

"I think I've talked about this a little bit, but the jack seven likes betting because it's cleaning outs. Queen jack from out of position will fold on the turn, so that means your straight outs and betting the jack seven are cleaner if we barrel."

### Future Bluffs

"No draw hands, we'll see how for the most part pretty classic patterns. We want some nine x to bluff on the straight completers for hands like jack nine and nine seven. Similarly, these sorts of hands are future bluffs for other straight completers."

"The one kind of difference I see here is the king jack and this is I think quite specific to lower boards. King jack really likes barreling because it cleans its out against ace jack and king queen. If we look at the folding hands ace jack and king queen are both folding on the turn, which means our jack out and our king out just get much better when we do barrel."

## Overcard Turns

### Strategic Considerations

"Next, I want to think a bit about the overcards. I think usually the overcards are going to favor, in position will generally pick up more top pairs on the overcards than out of position does, but our betting strategy will depend on how high the overcard is."

### Queen and Jack Turns

"On queen and jack I think both players pick up quite a few two pairs and straights. Probably want to still barrel our new top pairs but we need to be a little bit careful putting in too much money because of the nuts becoming more symmetric. So I think a smaller barrel makes sense on those cards."

"So on the jack and queen I expect medium bets. Some overbetting on the queen as well. It looks like here we find a medium bet or check."

### King and Ace Turns

"It looks like when you bet medium on the king and like queen jack and ace jack can just call again. I think that's why the overbet will be favored and they're actually still mixing even versus the overbet. By the looks there's just a lot of quite high equity hands on this king turn, so you tend to want to barrel a bigger size to make them indifferent rather than just happy to call."

"On the ace there's less of those really high equity draws so I think that's probably why it's slightly less important to bet big."

"I think just overbetting these high overcards is going to be good. I don't think it'll actually matter too much on the ace. You've got the linear advantage which you can build your strategy around or you can go more polar with the overbet."

## Lower Straight Completers (6, 9)

### General Strategy

"The next is going to be the lower straight completers. I think these are kind of hard because the nut advantage gets neutralized but we don't have the linear advantage like we do on the overcard straight completers and that usually leads me to a pot-size strategy."

"So when our main advantages in just our over pairs sort of hands, I tend to play a more pot size strategy, especially when the nuts are more neutral and that's because most of the ranges are more symmetric after flop goes bet call and we get a hand like this."

### Nine Turn Analysis

"So yeah, the barrel isn't the highest frequency. It's really leveraging this overpair advantage. Aces isn't worth a ridiculous amount just because of how many two pairs and straights there are on this sort of texture."

"Then we see ten x is very rarely betting. That's a big part to do with its removal effects on the hands we want out of position to have, which is somewhat clear I would say. All of the missed straights."

"These sets are checking it a lot here. See I think this is just a reflection of how many nuts there are in out of position range. The solver really likes protecting this range quite a bit with pretty strong hands."

### Six Turn Comparison

"The thing with low straight completers is the solver will play quite differently based on whether it's the nine or the six."

"On the six turn there's no off suited straits. So we'll get to barrel a lot more merged."

"Yeah, we see there's barrel frequency jump way up. We see our good top pairs returning and all of our over pairs barreling again. Our sets stop trapping just because of how many fewer nuts there are."

"So yeah, the important thing to think about on straight completers is how much does this actually change the nuts in the ranges. On the nine example, ten nine made two pair and nine eight made two pair queen jack and seven six made straights. So there were just heaps and heaps of nut combos. On the six turn there is significantly less."

"So you could actually argue this plays more like a brick than a straight completer. So yeah, it's important to really think about that when you're designing the strategy or playing."

### Bluffing on Straight Completers

"So on the previous straight completers I looked at in other videos we saw just random two undercards barreling. In this case, we're not seeing that. I think that's because we have so many candidate bluffs of hands that are just over under combos like these for example."

"So on the four straights, usually you want an all-in sizing based around the over straight and a kings a pretty relevant blocker in those lines."

"If you want to take this line, it's up to you. It's pretty crazy and their response is kind of awkward. They're meant to mix all the one card straights. It's kind of a cool line if you know what's happening, but I'd say it's not the most important thing to implement."

## Pairing Turns

### General Dynamics

"Finally, we just have the pairing turns. I think these will play somewhat similar to the other boards. They're always kind of the worst cards for in position."

"If we look at the hotness again, so we'll go to equity and yeah, they're again the lowest equity cards for in position."

### Sizing Patterns

"The barrel sizes, solver seems to usually overbet the top and the bottom and then go medium on the middle one. It's the kind of spot which comes up so rarely that I haven't put a lot of time into looking at."

### Adjustments to Bluffing Range

"We've talked about the barrel strategies before though. Draws often barrel less but we barrel some more kind of air balls. Those hands like the nine eight on the king seven two barrel quite often. In this case that hand strength is more like a king nine, which really likes barreling."

"This reflects that draws kind of want to keep the pots a bit smaller given the hands they make are less strong. These over under hands are really often barreling too, which is kind of cool. These are future bluffs for when our straight drill do get in."

## Key Takeaways

"Yeah. Sweet. I think that's about all I want to say on this board. Thanks for watching."
