My summary:
A new concept - future bluffs, when I bet with one card like just a Q or just Aspades,
so that when the spade comes or when the flush cards I have those bluffs on the river, so it's harder to bluff catch vs me.
# Turn Play Concepts and Framework

## Core Framework for Approaching Any Spot

"When I'm looking at any spot, I first think about what are the ranges. I then consider what strategy makes sense given these ranges. I'll think about the betting structure for the situation and then just how my hand fits into that. I'm going to go through an example of this thought process in the context of range betting."

## Understanding the Ranges

### Out of Position Range After Calling Flop Range Bet

"First, we need to work out what the ranges look like and OOP facing the range bet tends to raise most of their nutted hands and some of their best top pairs. That leaves the calling range as lots of top pairs. Most of the other board pairs, we see some of these raise in the solver whatever, if that happens in game or not, depends on the player. There are then a lot of pocket pairs. The draws and backdoor hands are the bluffs in the check-raise line, but these tend to get into the call some of the time too. Then there's lots of good overs and high card hands."

### In Position Range

"When we compare this to in position, in position just has their entire opening range."

## Strategic Considerations for Turn Play

### Nut Advantage and Symmetry

"We'll use these ranges going to turns and we need to think about what strategy our range wants to play. The first real consideration is the nutted hands, who has the advantage in these, and how symmetric they are. In position will usually have a nut advantage and that allows us to build usually reasonably high-frequency bets on the turn. If the nuts start to get more symmetric, in position needs to be a lot more cautious because out of position now has the hands to build aggressive raising strategies. Also, if they have nut hands, they can really attack our river checks if we don't protect them too much. This is always going to be a consideration, particularly on draw-completing cards where the nuts get a bit more symmetric."

### How Equities Run

"The next thing we want to consider is how do the equities run. It's a strange concept for humans to think about because we don't really think in equities, but the general idea is that if a board is higher equity for your range, you get to play higher frequency bets. This does depend more so on where this advantage is in the ranges."

## Practical Example: Comparing Turn Cards

"I've got an example here and I just want to consider our turn barrels on say king seven two rainbow with an eight turn versus king seven two rainbow with a queen turn. In both of these cases, the in position player will have a few more eight x or queen X than the out-of-position player and that's because we've bet our entire opening range whereas out-of-position will have folded some of their worst hands on the flop."

### K♥7♣2♦ Turn 8♠

"If we first considered the king seven two eight. Our eight x actually makes quite a lot of sense to be barreling. That's because it gets folds from hands like king jack, king queen from out of position as well as getting called by all of the lower pairs and a bunch of ace highs. On this sort of texture, the king seven two eight we'll probably quite like barreling quite linearly with lots of our eight x."

### K♥7♣2♦ Turn Q♠

"If we compare this to king seven two queen, the advantage in our range, we still have a nut advantage like we did on the other board, but in this case, our queen advantage doesn't really want to be betting. I think the strategy we would choose on this sort of board is a lot more polar and probably some overbets instead of a more linear strategy like on the eight."

## Turn Strategy Summary

"When we see the turn we want to consider the ranges. How do the nuts run, how are the equities and where is our advantage and does this want to bet? This should become more clear in the examples and it's a little bit abstract now, but I just want to get these principles on the table so we're kind of on the same page."

## Betting Range Structure

"Finally, once we've considered the overall strategy we will want to play, we want to think about the structure our betting range will take. This tends to depend mostly on whether you're in position or out of position, but also the SPR. So in range bet spots, the good news is that we always will use the same sort of betting structure. That comes in a probably quite familiar kind of thing. It's pretty similar to the category system."

### Categories of Hands

"We have our value hands, which is pretty clear usually, we then have equity bluffs, our draws. These are important to check some, so our checking range doesn't become too weak, but they're still good, classic semi-bluffs."

### Draw Selection Principle

"A nice concept to keep in mind is that the higher equity draws tend to barrel more often than the lower equity draws. We do want some nuance within this though. For example, within flush draws, we do want some flush draws in the checking range, but we'll use this concept within our flush draws. What I mean is that a combo draw will tend to bet most of the time, if not always, whereas our weaker flush draws will get used to help protect our checking range."

## Future Bluffs Concept

"The final concept I want to talk about is future bluffs. Now this might be new to some of you, but the idea is we like to bet some hands on the turn which become good bluffs on certain rivers."

### Example on K♠T♠3♥ Turn 6♣

"So a good example of this would be something like say king of spades, ten of spades, three of hearts. We range bet the flop, get called and we get say a six turn, I'd say of clubs. Here the main draws we'll be betting are hands like flush draws and then some straight draws like queen jack."

"To complement these hands, we'll want to barrel something like ace of spades four of clubs makes a lot of sense. By barreling this hand on the flush-completing rivers where you'll have a really nice hand to bluff because we have the ace of spades, which blocks some of the best flushes in out of position's range."

"Similarly, it makes sense to barrel a hand like queen of say diamonds, five of diamonds here. Now this hand looks a bit stranger than this hand to barrel, but the idea is that the queen five becomes a really nice bluff on rivers like the Ace and the nine where queen jack is a straight. Holding cards that kind of match the straight that happens would be good. This becomes a good bluff on virtually any of the high rivers. So ace, jack, and nine given it blocks the straights and by adding these future bluffs, it just becomes a lot harder to bluff catch versus given that a hand like King Queen is no longer just an excellent bluff catcher on these rivers."

## Key Takeaways

"Then finally, we just want to think about how a hand fits, which isn't really relevant for this general example. I hope this wasn't too abstract and I'm sure it'll all become clear in the examples I do next."
