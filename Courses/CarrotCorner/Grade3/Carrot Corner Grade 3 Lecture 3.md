Today's lecture is about common blocker effects: 
	The ways in which my hand interfere with my opponent's range, and prefer one action over another because of blocker effects. We already know that blocker effects aren't big enough to take a priority over a huge range advantage in theory/ exploitative scenarios where the villian is massively overfolding.
There can be several effects to blockers, for example:

Positive effects for bluffing: Block calls, unblock folds
(Negative effects for bluffing-Unblock calls, blocks folds)
Positive effects for calling: Block value, unblock bluff
(Negative effects for calling: Block bluff unblock value)

In today's lecture we're going to focus on unblocking folds.
