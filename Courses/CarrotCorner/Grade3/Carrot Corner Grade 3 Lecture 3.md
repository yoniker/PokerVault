Today's lecture is about common blocker effects: 
	The ways in which my hand interfere with my opponent's range, and prefer one action over another because of blocker effects. We already know that blocker effects aren't big enough to take a priority over a huge range advantage in theory/ exploitative scenarios where the villian is massively overfolding.
There can be several effects to blockers, for example:

Positive effects for bluffing: Block calls, unblock folds
(Negative effects for bluffing-Unblock calls, blocks folds)
Positive effects for calling: Block value, unblock bluff
(Negative effects for calling: Block bluff unblock value)

In today's lecture we're going to focus on unblocking folds.


The less folds we block, the more we can bluff. The more range advantage we have, we can bluff more. So in some situations, I can sometimes even bluff pure the worst hands(with the worst blockers), and in some bad spots for my range, I will only sometimes bluff the absolute best candidates for bluffing. Always first think about the range advantage, who has it, given the actions and configuration, and only then think about blockers - the range advantage dominates the blocker effects (in some spots I should bluff range).


## Hand Example

HJ vs BB SRP,
Flop comes KhJd7d, X/B75/C Turn 4s X/B150/C, River 2h BB X,

Now HJ has to decide between X or all-in

Questions:
1. How favorable is this of a world to HJ? Answer: It's neutral-by calling BB has a condensed range but has tons of EV vs HJ's range which is now quite polorised
2. Examine the following hands and determine how good of a bluff they are: Qh8h, Ad6d,Tc9c,AdTs,As3s: AdTs is a terrible hand  - I block both straight draws that missed and flush draws. Then Ad6d is a terrible hand to bluff with as I block a lot of BB's folding range,Qh8h/Tc9c are great and same as As3s: QT except exactly QdTd are folding turn, so all those hands unblocks all the folds so those are the best candidates for bluffing that spot (all of the go all-in pure, see https://app.gtowizard.com/solutions?solution_type=gwiz&gametype=Cash6m50zSimple25Open3betV2_SimpleOOP&depth=100&preflop_actions=F-R2.5-F-F-F-C&history_spot=11&depth_list=100&soltab=strategy&gmfs_solution_tab=ai_sols&gmfft_sort_key=0&gmfft_sort_order=desc&board=KhJd7d4s2h&flop_actions=X-R2.9-C&turn_actions=X-R18.15-C&river_actions=X&stratab=strategy_ev)
In general, to determine how the solver "thinks" regarding specific blockers, I can just look at the EV for that hand.
