Today's lecture is about common blocker effects: 
	The ways in which my hand interfere with my opponent's range, and prefer one action over another because of blocker effects. We already know that blocker effects aren't big enough to take a priority over a huge range advantage in theory/ exploitative scenarios where the villian is massively overfolding.
