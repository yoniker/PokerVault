Mixing is only ok when i expect to get roughly the save EV from the 2/3 actions i'm mixing between, and necessary only in a game with a high visibility (people can take notes on me or observe my tendencies in a live setting).

In this lecture we're going to look at facing a bet and mixing between fold/call/raise, identify the hands that are mixing and hands that aren't (=pure fold/pure call/pure raise)

## Turn Fold/call cutoff point
Let's start with an example:

Hand 1: CO vs BB SRP, flop Jd,3h,2c flop x/B30/C
Turn 7d X/B75 and now it's on us as BB when facing this. When we face a turn barrel in equilibrium (not against the maniac who overbluffs or the nit who underbluffs but against a competent player), we have a large cluster of hands that are 0EV (indifferent between calling and folding - some are raising but we will ignore this option for now and look only at calling/folding).

We have two thresholds: One threshold for robust hands (=hands that already have SDV) and one for draws(=frail hands).

Guided questions(for hand 1 as BB):
1. Where is our threshold for made hands?
2. Where is our threshold for C/F with our draws? What about my worst flush draws- are they continuing? Why or why not?
3. How does having a diamond affect the ev of calling a pocket pair?


Anaswers:

1. I need about 29% in EV to continue... Indifference point is 66 when it comes to robust hands

2. While all the flushes continue, vs a slightly bigger bet they don't - so this is sensitive.

3. pps without a diamond call much less: Their outs aren't as clean (one of them will complete a draw), and they block the CO's outs in case he has a flush draw.


Rank the following hands from highest to lowest in EV when calling:
8s8h, Ks7s,KdQd, AcQs,6h6d

KdQd is an excellent flush draw as well as two overpair draw - best EV.
Ks7s has 5 outs to improve to two pair plus in case it's behind - second best
8s8h - above 66 in ev just thx to its rank
6h6d
