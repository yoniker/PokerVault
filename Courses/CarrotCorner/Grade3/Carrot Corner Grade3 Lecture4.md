## Raising and beyond

What hands should I raise on the flop and why & What should I do with each type of hand on further streets after I get called

There are 5 classes of hands that I can *consider* raising on the flop:
1. Thick value region (Sets/flushes/straights)
2. Thin value region (Top pair decent kicker/Top pair bd flush draw/ mediocre overpair to a low board) - by raising those at some frequency for value i can also raise more bluffs and be more balanced
3. High EV bluff region: OESD, Flush draws, Nutshots (gutshot to the nuts)+good pair draw. It's only loosely a bluff - I have a ton of equity.
4. Hybrid region: low pair+low kicker for example, hands that have some attributes of value betting, bluffing and denial all at the same time 
5. Low-EV bluff region: BD flush+ BD straight,bad gutshot + overcard (aka pair draw) - I need those to forece villian to call with middling hands (otherwise he can fold those pure) - which would in turn reduce the EV of my region 1 hands


Unlike region 1 which is pure, regions  2+3 are mixing,
Humans are not finding as many raises as the solver especially in the regions 2,4,5.
