Mixing check/bet

I can simplify my bet strategy on the flop/turn/river to one/two sizing. Super complex strategies are a luxury of the solver that we can't afford.

The 5 buckets for check/bet:

Pure check, infrequent bet, sometimes bet, frequent bet, pure bet 

Flop Jc8d5hr turn 8s,
place each of the following hands in one of the 5 buckets:

1. Ad7h
2. AcQc
3. Js9s
4. AhJs
Answer:

1- frequently bet
2-pure check
3-sometimes bet
4-bet pure


On the river, if I have a value region of 30% and a value region of 120%,
bluffs will be rare at 30% because of pot odds: 
When I bet third pot, villian needs to be good only 20% of the time, so value:bluff ratio should be about 4:1. Twice as many bluffs will overbet since this will give villian about 33% pot odds - and i will be balanced at 2:1 value:bluffs.
