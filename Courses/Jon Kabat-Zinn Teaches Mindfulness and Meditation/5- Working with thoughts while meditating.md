# Quotes on Meditation and Mindfulness

## The Myth of the Blank Mind

> Among the misconceptions about meditation is one where, if you're meditating, your mind will be blank or will be clear. That you'll make your mind blank. Which is, of course, ridiculous. First of all, you can't make your mind blank. And if you try, you're just going to wind up with a gigantic headache. And second of all, it would not be desirable because a blank mind—what is that? There's no awareness whatsoever.

> When we're sitting, for instance, and we're attending to experience, especially in the early stages when you haven't practiced a lot with mindfulness of thinking, your thinking can seem like an obstacle. "Damn, I'd be a great mindfulness practitioner if it weren't for the fact that these thoughts just won't leave me alone. They're just buzzing around me like flies, like mosquitoes."

## The Mind as an Ocean

> Sometimes a classical analogy is that the mind is a lot like a large body of water, like the ocean. And depending on atmospheric conditions, it can be totally calm, and we've all had moments, at least glimpses, where we were so calm that it felt really, really, really special. And we can even remember those very few moments in our lives when we felt so calm.

> And then the mind starts going and becomes sometimes seriously oppressive, and we want to be freed from it, liberated from this oppressive mind. And the idea is like, "if only I could learn to meditate, just shut off my mind, then everything would be great. Make my mind go blank."

> Well, that's tantamount to taking a body of water like the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, or whatever it is, and expecting that it should always be flat. Yes, when atmospheric conditions are just right—as sailors know—you could be calmed for days, that there's no wind and the water is like glass. That same ocean, the next day, can have waves 100 feet high. Enormously turbulent. It's just like that with the surface of the mind. The thoughts are the waves. They're turbulent and they're driven by emotions.

> But—we all know this, too—if you drop down under the surface of the ocean 20 or 30 meters, even in the midst of hurricane-force waves and wind, gentle undulation. Just total calm. It's the same with the mind.

> The more you learn to drop in, even though things are agitated up here and caught up and so forth, when you drop into awareness itself, that agitation is already in a much, much bigger space. Almost as if to reverse the direction—instead of going down where there's nothing but stillness, if you go up 30,000 or 40,000 feet in an airplane, those waves look like just little ripples in the mind.

## The Practice of Mindfulness

> What the meditation practice can offer is a new way to be in relationship with the waving of the mind so that one, we don't get caught up in it. Two, we don't take it personally, because the content is really, very often, extremely emotional and turbulent and challenging.

> We can find the calmness right here, right now, stabilize that calmness by exercising the muscle and practicing. We get better and better at actually dropping into stillness and then not trying to fix or make it all go away, but to just let it do its thing so over time, of course, all those storms dissolve.

> You could think of emotions and thoughts—especially turbulent ones—as weather patterns in the mind. And what mindfulness does is allow you to actually apprehend the weather conditions, not take any of it personally or get caught up in it, and be in relationship to it in such a way as it doesn't sink your ship.

## Objects of Attention vs. Attending

> My working definition or operational definition of mindfulness is the awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally. And when we pay attention, usually we're paying attention to something. So that something is technically called an object of attention.

> The cardinal thing to keep in mind... The meditation practice is not about the objects of attention. It's about the attending itself, okay? So even the breath—which we pay a lot of attention to—but it's not about the breath. We're utilizing the breath as a way to ride, herd on, and lasso in, and befriend, and familiarize ourselves with the nature of what the mind and the body is doing, and the world.

> The objects of attention are vehicles or pathways, or sort of conduits by which we can actually learn how to attend. That's the function of awareness.

> So the flashlight of attention—shine it on the belly, shine it on the breath sensations or whatever, but we're not interested primarily in whatever the object of attention is. It could be anything. But what we're very interested in is the attending.

## The Mind as a Mirror

> What if we invited the thought mirror into awareness? With a mirror, something comes in front of the mirror. It's there. And then it goes, and the mirror doesn't reach out and try to grab the object. No, the mirror is completely open. And when red comes, reflects red. Blue comes, it reflects blue. It doesn't say, "I have an allegiance to red. Sorry, I don't reflect blue or white or black or brown or anything." The mirror is just reflecting what's over here.

> Now what if we related to thought in the same way? This thought arises of, "I got to go shopping for dinner," and it comes and it goes. And the mirror doesn't pursue it, doesn't hang on to it. It doesn't push it away. It's just neutral. It sees a thought arising as an event in the field of awareness, just an event.

> If you don't feed them, they come and they go. They arise and they pass away, and very quickly.

> We let them just be and we see their nature as thought, rather than as truth. That's the experiential network, you see, as opposed to the default mode network, where it's just one thought leading to another and you're carried off in the thought stream.

> But when you put out the welcome mat for thoughts, then we can just watch them with as much dispassion, so to speak, as a mirror reflecting whatever comes before it. The mirror's just being itself no matter what, and you can, too.

## William James on Attention

> In 1890, William James, who is often spoken of as the father of American psychology, made the following statement in his *Principles of Psychology*: "The faculty of bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. Nobody is *compos sui* if he have it not." (*Compos sui* means master of herself or master of himself.) "An education which would improve this capacity would be the education par excellence, but it is easier to define this ideal than to give practical suggestions for bringing it about."

> You know what the practical instructions for bringing it about are called? They're called mindfulness.

> Here's the practical means for bringing it about that he was complaining wasn't available. You see what's on your mind. You notice that it's drifted away from the breath. And then you know what's on your mind, and you just come back to the belly or to the nostrils, or wherever the breath sensations are most vivid. And then guess what? Within a few seconds, your mind is going to go off again. And you bring it back again, and you bring it back again.

> The mind wandering is actually your ally in showing you how unruly the untamed mind is, but it's actually trainable. It's tameable.

## The Inner Commentator

> It might be useful, sometimes, to just play with or experiment with pretending that you're watching a game inside your own head. And lo and behold, this bloody commentator that's just endlessly talking about, "Sit up straight." Throwing meditation instructions at you. "Drop in on your breath. Stop. Drop." ... It's you doing commentary on yourself about how bad a meditator you are.

> The best way to do it is to just shut down the volume. Turn down the sound on the commentator and watch the game. Apprehend the game. Let the game of whatever your experience is in the present moment come to the fore.

> And then it turns out that there's nothing that's not part of the game. If it happened, it's part of the game. It's part of the adventure. It's part of the love affair. This thought arose. You don't want to deal with that thought, but it arose, so can you just see it as a thought? ... The awareness is not at all touched by either the thought or the aversion. So there, you're already free. If you don't feed it, it will just attenuate on its own. Next.
