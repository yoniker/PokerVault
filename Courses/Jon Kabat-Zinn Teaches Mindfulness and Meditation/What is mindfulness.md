## Core Concepts

### Defining Mindfulness

"What mindfulness is has been in dispute for thousands of years. Different traditions speak about it in slightly different ways. But I came a long time ago to formulate this operational definition that we could employ in medicine and health care that would be commonsensical and understandable to people and yet also be mysterious and, in a certain way, something where you couldn't just get it by thinking, that it's designed to point to something beyond mere cognition."

"So it's, mindfulness is the awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose in the present moment and nonjudgmentally."

### Understanding the Components

"So it sounds perfectly understandable. Anybody can get that. Paying attention-- anybody can do that. On purpose-- well, we have to sometimes be intentional about what we're doing. In the present moment-- it turns out this is much harder to actually live than you would think. But everybody understands at least what 'in the present moment' invites out of us. It means to be in the present, here now."

### The Nonjudgmental Aspect

"And then the nonjudgmentally part, which people really misunderstand because the nonjudgmental part doesn't mean that you won't have judgments. The nonjudgmental part means that you'll, in some sense, become aware of how unbelievably judgmental we all are. And we've got ideas and opinions about virtually everything, likes and dislikes."

"So the nonjudgmental piece means that we will realize how judgmental we are, and we won't judge the judging. But we'll let it all play out in the present moment, embrace it in awareness through paying attention in this particular kind of friendly way, and see what unfolds, what is to be realized or experienced or recognized when you start to cultivate intimacy with awareness."

### The Power of Awareness

"And we talk about awareness as if, yeah, you know, what's the big deal? I mean, I'm aware. I'm aware it's snowing. I'm aware it's cold. I'm aware that I'm annoyed, or whatever. But awareness really has not gotten anywhere near the kind of attention and investigation and appreciation that it deserves. It's one of our human superpowers."

"And it's much more powerful than thought because you can take any thought no matter how big, like the nature of the universe or the nature of the multiverse or whatever it is, infinity. And you can hold that thought and whatever pictures arise in the mind because of that thought in awareness. And how could you hold it in awareness if awareness wasn't a larger space for holding conceptual thought?"

"So it's another profound form of human intelligence but that, in our society at least, has gotten very little airtime, very little appreciation. So we exercise the muscle of discernment and discriminative thinking and analytical thinking to a huge degree. But we never really attend to this other form of deep inquiry and discernment that has to do with the direct recognition of things in awareness, which only happens in the present moment."

## Common Misconceptions

### About Meditation and Buddhism

"There are a lot of misconceptions and preconceptions about meditation and about mindfulness. And let's be very clear about it. Mindfulness is traditionally a form of meditation, okay? And it's often spoken of as the heart of Buddhist meditation."

"And really, you know, the word 'Buddhism' to describe this was coined by Westerners. The Buddhists, the people who've been doing it for all those thousands of years, they did not actually call themselves Buddhists. But I think what happened was various kinds of scholars of one kind from Europe wound up in Asia. And they saw these Buddhist statues, you know? And they just made a one-to-one correspondence with Christ and churches. And they thought, well, they're worshipping this divinity, not understanding that actually there is no divinity, technically speaking, in Buddhism."

"It's about wakefulness."

### The Purpose and Benefits

"And of course, science has now showed, I think, quite convincingly at this point that there are profound benefits from training in this particular form of mental exercise. These benefits include changes in the brain. They include changes in the immune system. They include changes in the heart."

"And of course, how are people going to swallow that one and digest it? You know, what the hell does that mean, relationality? I'm not even sure it's an English word."

## Understanding Relationality and Self

### The Question of Identity

"So here's one way of thinking about it, is, like, we're in the habit of saying, my body or my breathing. So there's a relationship. There's the body. That we don't have any problem with. But who's the 'my'? Who is it that's saying, 'it's my body'?"

"And this is where the personal pronouns come in. And they're very, very interesting to start to become mindful of and how often we generate 'I', 'me', and 'my' and then contract around those personal pronouns and self-identify in small ways-- not with the body. Although we do that all the time, too."

"My body's not-- and then fill in the blank-- young enough, old enough, big enough, small enough, radiant enough, luminous enough. We have a lot of problems with the body."

### Mindfulness as Investigation

"And in a very real way, mindfulness could be thought of as a laboratory in which we get to investigate over a limited period of time whether in fact it is possible to get a handle on who you actually are in a way that would promote ongoing learning."

"And whenever we're really learning-- I mean, hopefully learning doesn't end with formal education. So whenever we're learning, what's the consequence of that learning? It's not just filling the head with facts. We're growing in a certain way. We're growing into this larger view of how things are."

## Healing and Transformation

### Redefining Healing

"And my working definition of healing is really important because most people think that healing is the same as curing. We're not trying to make things the way they were before you got your diagnosis or before this happened and completely changed your life and was, you know, really painful."

"But what we can do is come to terms with the actuality of things. We can come to terms with things as they are by embracing them in moment-to-moment awareness."

### The Process of Change

"And then we see how turbulent our emotions are, what kinds of narratives are still running in the head about the injustice of it, or whatever it is, how much the suffering is actually driven by the grief, the loss, the constant rumination about what happened and the narratives we build around it."

"And when you can hold all that in awareness without trying to make any of it go away or fix it, but you just see this as an unfolding, then what happens is you're actually coming to terms with the actuality of the way it is."

"And then out of this coming to terms with things as they are, something shifts. You remember that you're much bigger than the stories you tell yourself about who you are, which are very often diminishing stories. They're very often straight-jacketing stories. They're very often harsh, not loving, not appreciative."

### The Path to Transformation

"And so beyond the trajectory of learning, growing, healing, we move into the domain of transformation, where you're the same person you always were, and you're not."

"So these are very, sort of, powerful lenses through which to investigate the question and really, in some sense, the deep question of what mindfulness is."

## Key Takeaways

"But when push comes to shove, and the reason we're even having this kind of a program, is that mindfulness is not a concept. It's a way of being in wise relationship with life unfolding in the only moment that it ever does. And it really is, in a certain way, a superpower that goes completely unrecognized."
