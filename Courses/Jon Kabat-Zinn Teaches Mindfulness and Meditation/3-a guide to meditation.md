# Mindfulness Practice: Formal and Informal Meditation

## Formal vs Informal Practice

### Defining the Two Types

"So sometimes I use the terminology of formal meditation practice and informal meditation practice. Formal meditation practices are the meditation practices that have names like the body scan, sitting meditation, mindful Hatha yoga, mindful walking. Those are all formal meditation practices."

"Another way to look at it is you have to carve out time for them."

"Informal meditation is life itself. And what we're really talking about is cultivating awareness."

### The Nature of Awareness

"And sense awareness is part of the repertoire of our humanity, this is, kind of, a systematic way of befriending and reconnecting and familiarizing ourselves with this capacity that we're all born with and that never gets any airtime in school."

"Again, I'm not saying that we need to cultivate awareness. We already are aware. So we don't have to exercise the muscle of awareness. It's a gift, and we have it."

"What we need to do is cultivate access to that awareness, because it's so easily eclipsed by thinking. Because that's what we learn in school is how to be really, really good thinkers."

### Immediate Accessibility

"So awareness is like an incredibly powerful human faculty, and mindfulness meditation is cultivating access to awareness."

"And as soon as you take your seat and as soon as you drop in on the breath and as soon as you start attending on purpose in the present moment as nonjudgmentally as possible, then it's already here."

"It's not like if you sit now and practice and move to a monastery in the Himalayas, 50 years from now maybe you'll obtain awareness. No, it's already."

## Meditation Is Not What You Think

### A Way of Being

"And so you know there's a way in which meditation really is not what you think. It's literally not what you think, but it's also not all those ideas and opinions that you may have accrued over the course of your lifetime about what meditation is."

"Because all of that is kind of oriented towards making it into a thing, and it's not a thing. It's a way. Let's even say with a capital W. It's a way of being."

"And we can do it, but it does require exercising the muscle. It does require a certain kind of discipline to engage in the meditative practices, the formal meditation practices as if your life depended on it."

## The Necessity of Formal Practice

### The Illusion of "Just Being Mindful"

"You know, there are people who will say, well, I'm really into mindfulness, but I just live my life moment by moment. And I don't do any of that real practice or formal practice, because it takes too much time, and I'm too busy. I don't have any time for that."

"I think for the most part, this is kidding oneself. You can't do the life is practice unless you're grounding it in the formal practice, because all you need to do is get your ass on the cushion once and you'll see the nature of your own mental disturbances even if it's just like the wandering mind being all over the map and meanwhile you're supposed to be attending to your breath, and you couldn't string two or three breaths together."

### The Gift of Recognition

"But to actually realize that the mind is that labial, that's a profound gift. That's a profound gift, because if you see it, you realize the impact that that can have even in how you are in relationship to your children. Never mind your colleagues at work, never mind what your true work is, which you may never get to because your mind is so labial that you haven't-- you're doing everything that second-order and forgetting what's first-order."

"These are some of the risks associated with thinking that you can just be mindful all day long without anchoring it in formal practice."

### Like Brushing Your Teeth

"And believe me, I've seen it over the years in millions of people, including myself. It may seem artificial for the first five or 10 years, but after a while you know it's no more artificial than brushing your teeth in the morning."

"This is in some sense brushing your mind, examining the nature of your own mind and tuning the instrument before you take it out on the road to play it, because the mind is a very delicate thing. And it also can get out of tune very quickly, and then the notes fall flat."

## The Non-Activity of Meditation

### Being vs Doing

"And meditation is kind of an interesting activity to invite people to engage in, because it's the one human activity that's not a human activity. It's not an activity. It's not a doing. It's a being."

"I don't actually know anything else. I can't think of anything else that's quite like this, because it's really a non-doing and it involves non-striving."

### The Balance of Instrumental and Non-Instrumental

"And so when we come to meditation in the early stages, of course, we need to be instrumental about it, because otherwise we won't set it up to practice at all. We have to have certain kinds of intentions. We set the alarm a little bit earlier. Remember to meditate in bed. Remember to get down on the floor and do yoga, whatever it is that requires being instrumental, making things happen."

"But we're setting up the instrumental as a kind of gateway to the non-instrumental to the non-doing and the non-striving that we've been pointing to."

"And so there's, kind of, beautiful balance between being and doing, and the non-instrumental in some sense nurtures the instrumental."

## The Flow State Example

### The Outfielder's Catch

"And we can see this all the time in sports. Like, the classic example is like when somebody goes back-- an outfielder goes back for a fly ball. It's like just impossible to catch."

"And the amount of physics that has to go on to calculate the trajectory and the play of gravity and how fast they're running and the angle that the sun and they jump as far as they can, and they aren't looking at the ball and they put their hand up and the ball is in the glove."

"And every 30,000 people in the stands just go, oh my god. How does someone do that? They don't do that by thinking and calculating the physics of the trajectory of the ball or of their glove or anything like that."

### Pure Ballet

"In fact, I don't know how you do it, but it's not an instrumental being that's doing all the doing."

"But what it does, and one of the reasons we love sports, is that when you see something like that it's just totally unbelievable. It's pure ballet."

"But it means that we have to both train really hard and at the same time get out of our own way and just let the body and our natural capacity for what's sometimes called flow, getting into flow where it's no longer the thinking mind that's doing any of this. It's some other aspect of what we call physical intelligence that's just, kind of, very, very interesting and that we all have."

### Universal Capacity

"You don't have to be a professional Major League ballplayer. This is something that's native to us."

"And so when we take our seat in whatever ways we do literally and metaphorically when we drop in, then we're actually engaging in a beautiful blending of the instrumental that's required to get us to take our seat and then the non-instrumental, which is that dropping into being and the letting go of any attachment to outcome whatsoever."

"And the irony is that when you let go of those attachments to outcome, you get the more desired outcome often and a certain kind of mystery to it and a certain kind of in some sense poetic justice."

## The Time Commitment

### You've Got Nothing But Time

"Well, the thought may be arising in your mind of like, my god, what a giant commitment this must be I don't have the time to commit to something this grandiose so to speak. And that's a very valid thought."

"Here's another thought to in some sense perry it. You got nothing but time. The whole question is, how are you going to use the time that you have?"

### Too Serious to Take Seriously

"The stakes are actually extremely high. They're so high that it's important not to take this whole thing too seriously."

"So I like to say that this is way too serious to take too seriously, and so we have to approach it with a sense of humor. It's too serious to take seriously, and I'm serious about that."
