# Mindfulness Meditation: Posture, Intentionality, and "Falling Awake"

**Topic:** Meditation Posture (Sitting & Lying Down), The Zafu, Mudras, and the Concept of "Falling Awake."

### Options for Taking Your Seat

> "You don't have to sit on the floor. That's point number one... anywhere you sit is fine, and not sitting at all. Lying down would be fine or standing on your head."

> "But there are certain virtues to grounding yourself sitting on the floor... I'm sitting on a cushion which is called the **Zafu**, so that my pelvis is rooted on the Zafu. And because I'm not sitting on the top of this thing... but I'm sitting on the forward part of it, my pelvis naturally tilts forward."

### The Biomechanics of Dignified Sitting

> "It's a forward tilting rotation which allows my spine to actually have that natural lordotic curve come out of the pelvis... and right through the top of the head. So the entire spine is positioned so that it can do its natural curves that optimally carry the head and the body."

> "The real meditation practice doesn't have anything to do with how the body is configured. The most important thing is that when you take your seat, whether it's on the chair or whether it's on the floor, that you establish yourself... **in a posture that embodies wakefulness and dignity.**"

> "To take one side is to actually find a way to be really balanced so that one's not falling forward, one's not falling backward. And the muscles of the body are exquisitely designed to do this, so that rather than being tense, they just have their natural tone but they're in exquisite balance from side to side and from front to back."

### Hand Positions (Mudras)

> "All of these different positions of the hands, which are called **Mudras**, have a certain kind of signature to them—an energy signature, a proprioceptive signature... and they can actually help you tune your meditation practice or your intention before you take your seat."

### The "Curriculum" of Discomfort & The Radical Act of Being

> "I'll just stress that the meditations we're doing [in] this class are long for a reason. **You're supposed to get bored and uncomfortable. Working through boredom and discomfort is part of the curriculum.**"

> "But the most important thing is that you come to it with a kind of intentionality... **It's actually a radical act of sanity to get off the train of constant doing and just take a few moments at least to drop into being.**"

> "We sit down all the time, but we don't sit down with the intention to wake up... Maybe sitting down actually is being awake if you come to it with this intentionality that you are already awake. Again, there's no place to go, nothing to do, nothing to attain. You're already here. This is it."

### Lying Down Meditation & Falling Awake

> "There's a certain way in which lying down meditation doesn't get probably as much attention as it deserves given how powerful it can be... We do an awful lot of lying down in our lives, because we usually sleep in a horizontal position."

> "But actually taking time rather than to fall asleep, to **fall awake**—and training oneself to fall awake in this position—is really powerful."

> "Falling asleep is an occupational hazard of all lying down meditation practices. So we have to actually train ourselves and learn how to fall awake when we come to that fork in the road where one way is sleep and the other way is more and more awake."

> "We're not striving or forcing wakefulness. We're just naturally falling awake with the same kind of ease that we could easily fall asleep."

### The Corpse Pose (Savasana)

> "We can let the floor do all the work... And then the invitation is to simply [follow] in what's technically called in yoga, the Corpse Pose."

> "It's said that of all the 84,000 mainstream yoga poses... it's said that the Corpse Pose is by far the most difficult. Because what's really involved in the Corpse Pose, as is implied by the name, is dying."

> "In a very special way, we're inviting ourselves to **die to the future and die to the past and therefore actually wake up into the present moment**, which is the only moment we actually ever have for learning, growing, healing, transformation, for expressing love. Whatever it is, this is it."
