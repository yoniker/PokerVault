# Mindfulness Attitudinal Factors Transcript

## Introduction to Attitudinal Factors

"When you set about bringing mindfulness in some kind of disciplined way into your life as a love affair with the unfolding of life itself, and an experiment in making sure you're not missing your moments, or driving through your moments to get the better moments, or constantly caught up in reactivity, it's helpful to keep certain elements in mind."

"So these factors that are sometimes called attitudinal factors, they really set the stage for taking your seat, or taking a stand in the present moment. So they, in some sense, really round out the practice and are essential to the practice."

"They are not things that you force on yourself, but rather that you just keep in mind, so to speak. Or maybe it would be even more appropriate to say, keep in heart."

## Non-Judging

### Understanding Non-Judging

"So the first of these is non-judging. And as I've said, non-judging does not mean that you won't be judging. It means that in some sense you'll become really mindful of how judging you, and I, and all of us are constantly."

"And we won't judge that judging. But the awareness of the judging and the intention to not be caught by it is in itself a kind of beautiful and very gentle practice of, in some sense, caring enough about yourself and whatever circumstances you find yourself in to not immediately collapse and contract around liking and disliking, wanting or not wanting, pushing away or driving towards."

### Liberation from Judgments

"Because really we are prisoners of our own judgments when it comes down to it, because it reduces our possibilities for responding to challenging situations, instead of reacting mindlessly, more or less, habitually every time certain things come up, and we contract into a view that may not be the whole story, the whole view."

"So this is actually the heart of meditative practice. And this is a fundamental-- I don't even want to call it a skill, because then it just sounds too pedestrian or mundane. It's an adventure. It's part of the adventure of seeing that we don't have to be imprisoned by our own likes and dislikes."

"And, in fact, that we can liberate ourselves from our unconscious attachment to our likes and dislikes, and our wants and our fears. And this then just seamlessly integrates, as do all these other factors, and many more besides, into the practice itself."

## Patience

### Recognizing Impatience

"And the second of these attitudinal factors, as they're unfolded in full catastrophe living at least, is the quality of patience."

"And the beauty of keeping patience even as a possibility in mind, not some kind of ideal, but just the possibility in mind is that we immediately become aware of how impatient we are, and how at times we want to get to an end result, and will drive through whatever is between us and that end result."

"And so we're kind of forcing ourselves to get out of the present moment because we're anticipating some better present moment in the future."

### The Impact of Impatience

"And this is, in some sense, unwise and creates damage sometimes, because other people have to live with your impatience. And it has an aggressive element to it sometimes."

"The victims, let's say, of our impatience are often the people that we live with and love the most, or people that we work with, and might actually feel that a steady diet of my impatience is, in some sense, really disregarding, if not abusive."

### The Wisdom of Patience

"So impatience isn't just something that you benefit from recognizing and then cultivating patience in yourself. But other people around you will benefit from it enormously as well."

"Now, it doesn't mean you have to be satisfied with things as they are. Of course, we all want change in a direction that's truly transformational, beneficial, and healing. But as the old zen sayings goes, you can't push the river."

"And it's unwise to kind of hurry yourself up to get someplace, and thereby forget that there's no place to go, nothing to do, and no special something that we're after."

"So a patience as a quality that we could cultivate is deeply related to trust..."

## Non-Striving

### The Paradox of Non-Striving

"So non-striving is really deeply related to trust, that it's really a reminder that you can probably get more work done-- I've had this experience many times-- and better work by not being attached to the outcome and striving to get the thing done, but to simply take care of it and honor what's required to make sure every piece of it has integrity. And it'll get done when it gets done."

"Now, of course, we have to work with the real world, deadlines, and everything else. But just bringing that to the fore in your own consciousness actually can help you get things done a lot faster."

### Professional Sports Example

"It turns out that non-striving really is useful when you're very, very goal oriented. And one way you can see that is in professional sports. And professional sports has taken to mindfulness in various sports, some more than others over the past 10 or 15 years than ever before."

"And professional athletes are like incredibly goal oriented, and more than goal oriented. They don't just want to score goals or baskets. They want to win, okay? So you could say they would be attached to the outcome of winning."

"But they also understand that when you're too attached to the outcome of winning, paradoxically you can get in your own way and lose the game, because the mind wasn't clear."

### The Competitive Edge

"So if Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Steph Curry can practice mindfulness-- and there aren't any more competitive people that I know on the planet-- then maybe we should rethink this whole question about how, well, non-striving will like take the hunger out of my desire to win."

"It doesn't mean that you become a passive person who never gets anything done. I mean, I know thousands of people out there who are highly accomplished, people in every domain of life who are all meditating. And no one feels, oh, the meditation is taking the edge off of me."

"Quite the opposite, many of them will say that's where my competitive edge comes from. I've got this other profound resource to tap into that's like an oxygen line straight into the heart."

## Acceptance

### What Acceptance Really Means

"So acceptance is another one of these attitudinal factors. So let's think about acceptance for a moment."

"So acceptance really means seeing the actuality of things, and recognizing and accepting that they're like this. Acceptance doesn't mean you can't work to change them."

"If you, oh, I'm just going to accept being a witness to a murder, or social injustice of any kind, acceptance doesn't mean, oh, ho-hum, it's not my business, not me, not my family."

### Not Passive Resignation

"So acceptance doesn't mean like I just accept everything the way it is. Acceptance means seeing clearly what the reality is and letting it actually register with you."

"Okay, then you've accepted it, which means you've recognized maybe the unacceptable at times. And then the question is, how am I going to be in wise relationship with what's intolerable, what needs to be changed?"

"So it has nothing to do with passive resignation. But a lot of people confound the two, and they think, oh, when they talk about acceptance they just mean like you give up your spine. And you just passively resign yourself to these forces that are bigger than you and you can't do anything."

### Clear Seeing and Action

"If that winds up being the case, humanity is really screwed. Okay, that we need the exact opposite at this moment in time. We need to see the actual reality of what's going on, in all its complexity and all its simplicity."

"And then that's the acceptance part, but no resignation whatsoever. It's just clear seeing, and then action, acting, coming out of apprehending harm being done, for instance, and taking a stand, a principled stand, an ethical stand."

"So acceptance does not mean passive resignation. But it means a deep insightful recognition of things as they are. And if you are the only one that sees the way things are, and everybody else is saying it's some other way, trust yourself."
