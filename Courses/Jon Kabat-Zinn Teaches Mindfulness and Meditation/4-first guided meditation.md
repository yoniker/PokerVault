# Guided Meditation Transcript

## Introduction to Practice

"So this is kind of meant to be a kind of introduction to formal meditation practice, which we're going to be diving into from a lot of different angles in various ways."

"But for now, let's just establish ourself in a posture that embodies wakefulness and dignity, as you're gazing at the image on your screen. And the invitation is to kind of just drop in, feeling your body."

## The Posture

"If you care to, you can bring awareness to a sense of the carriage of the body, how the body is sitting in space on the chair. How the spine comes out of the pelvis, how the shoulders are on the rib cage, how the head and neck are positioned."

"There's no one right way to do it, and it's not about sort of ramrod stiff or anything like that. But to simply drop into the body as a whole sitting and, guess what, breathing."

### Eyes Open or Closed

"By the way you can do this with your eyes closed. I give you permission to not look at me on the screen, or you can do it with your eyes open."

"The important thing to remember, although I've used the verb doing, is that it's not a doing. You're just dropping into being, and what's coming at you through the eyes, through the ears, through proprioception, through all the other senses are just part of the domain of present moment experience."

## Focusing on the Breath

### Finding the Breath in the Body

"And let's just drop into one element of the experiencing of the body sitting here, and that is that it's breathing."

"So one thing that you can do is actually focus in on the breath sensations in the body, because it's a very, very effective way of stabilizing the mind and grounding it in the present moment."

"So seeing if you can just feel someplace in the body, the sensations associated with this breath coming in. And then this breath leaving the body, and then this breath coming in, and then this breath leaving."

### Not Forcing the Breath

"Now, we're not trying to push or pull the breath. We're simply being breathed, so to speak, letting it simply flow in and out of its own accord, but we're feeling it in the body."

### Where to Feel the Breath

"And be aware of where you've chosen to attend to it, where the mind has alighted in the body to feel the breath, especially if you're brand new to it. This is part of the adventure. Where do you feel the breath?"

"So very often, people will feel it at the nostrils, because like that's a no-brainer. And yes, you can notice that you can bring your attention right to the tip of the nose and the openings of the nostrils, and you can feel the air moving in and out."

### The Belly as an Anchor

"As I do it, I'm noticing that my belly is actually expanding every time the breath comes in. And the belly is deflating somewhat every time the breath goes out, almost as if there were a balloon in the belly."

"But let me just suggest, if you care to play with it, that for now, in part because it's the farthest away you can get from the head, where all this thinking seems to be located, that we drop down into the belly."

### Riding the Waves

"So we're basically riding on the waves of the breath, as it comes into the body, and as it leaves the body with full attention."

"I sometimes think of it as like surfing on the waves of the breath."

"And there's the in breath, and then there is the moment when the in breath stops and the out breath begins. And there's the out breath. And then there's that moment when the out breath stops, and then the in breath begins again."

## Working with the Wandering Mind

### The Discovery

"And right now, you may already have noticed that as focused as you may have been on the breath sensations in the body, the mind has already gone someplace else. It's like, oh god, this guy is just going on and on, and this is like incredibly boring."

"Or maybe it's not a judgment, but it's something else like, where is this going or I hope this is going to help me with my problems. Or, wait a minute, I've got so much to do, and here I'm like wasting time sitting here in front of a computer, breathing."

### Noticing Without Judgment

"Whatever thoughts are going through your mind, the invitation is actually to simply notice what's on your mind. And then, it's like, oh, wait a minute, here's this next breath."

"And so you find your way back to riding on the waves of the breathing, breath by breath, moment by moment."

### The Natural State of Mind

"But as we do this, we're in some sense discovering that the mind has what you might call a mind of its own. And we have very little control over what comes up in the mind. All kinds of thoughts can come, can be sparked by the slightest thing, and carry us away."

"And we might be carried away for two or three or five or 10 or 20 or 100 thoughts before we go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I was supposed to be feeling the breath sensations, riding on the waves of the breath. It's like, where have I been?"

### The Practice of Returning

"This is a really good thing. You're discovering that your mind is all over the place, because this is not going to be either the first time or the last time that this will happen. This is going to happen endlessly. It's part of the practice."

"So the instruction then becomes, as you sit and ride on the waves of your breathing in the belly, or wherever the sensations are most vivid for you in the body, moment by moment by moment and breath by breath by breath, noticing every time the mind gets lost."

### Without Self-Criticism

"And then letting it be exactly as it is, not pursuing it, not pushing it away. Not condemning yourself for the mind having wandered or criticizing or judging yourself in any way. Just see it. Don't take it personally."

"Let it be as it was, and here's this breath coming in or going out, whatever, when you drop back in."

### The Endless Return

"And if the mind wanders 100 times in the space of 5 minutes or 10 minutes, every time you ask yourself, you invite yourself, to simply see what's on your mind in that moment and come back without pushing anything away or condemning anything."

"Or without pursuing what was on your mind, because it's so much more interesting and enticing than your breath sensations."

### The Challenge and the Love Affair

"So you can see that this is actually a very, very challenging invitation, and that it does involve a great degree of discipline. And a willingness to as a love affair gentle yourself into seeing what's on your mind and coming back to the breath sensations in the body over and over and over and over and over again."

"Every time being the first time, because we're taking up residence in this only moment we call now."

## Embodied Awareness

"And learning how to inhabit the space of the body, if you will, the space of awareness, until they're not two, no separation, embodied awareness."

"You simply dropping in on this moment as it is and resting here, moment by moment by moment, with things exactly as they are. Inwardly in the mind, the body, and outwardly in the world, sounds, whatever kinds of activities may be going on in the environment, and you're at home."

## The Non-Striving

"So for now, there's no place to go, nothing to do, and no special something that you're trying to attain, just this, just this."

"Just this moment, just this breath, just this sitting here, just this being human, just this, just this."

## Closing and Continuity

### Transitioning Out

"Then, as this brief, introductory, guided meditation comes to a close, if your eyes have been closed, then slowly inviting them to open. Staying in touch with the body breathing, maybe shifting your posture a little bit."

### Seamless Continuity

"It's seeing if you can keep up a seamless continuity in the awareness of breathing in the body, even as we move into whatever is next."

"So in this way, we're actually intentionally inviting ourselves to remember that the meditation practice is not separate at all from life itself and we don't stop breathing when the meditation comes to an end."

### Life as Practice

"And it would be helpful if we could actually bring the boundless spaciousness of the awareness that we've been cultivating, even as we attend to this simple rhythmic motion breathing, if we can stay in touch with it here in the body. Moment by moment, as we get up, as we move around, as we take on whatever is next."

"And so in that way, we're really asserting that the meditation practice is life itself, and we're embodying it simply by remembering that, even if I ring bells to signal the end of a period of meditation, there's no end to the meditation practice."

"It's life itself, and any moment is a perfect moment for actually being fully present."
