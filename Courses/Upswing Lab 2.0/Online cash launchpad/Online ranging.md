# Hand Reading Video - Linus Loeliger Analysis

## Introduction

"Hey guys, what's up? This is meant to be a complimentary to Tim's ranging video and I felt like it would just be good to go through examples of ranging. I feel like it's such an important skill to develop, to develop the skill of hand reading. So we'll do this more as we go. I wanted to have a few more hands in there. So what I'm gonna do is just go through a few very big exciting hands played by Linus Loeliger in the Coin Poker Challenge and we're gonna see the hands at the end."

"So just an example of the lot of different situations here. The rock one, basically assume everyone here is very good and the rock 1, 2, 3 specifically is less of a pro, which is why you see 'em limping."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: Linus (BU) vs Rock (LJ) - Three-Bet Pot

**Stakes: $50/$100, $19,000 effective**

- **Preflop:** Rock limps from LJ, Linus raises to $280 from BU, Rock 3-bets to $990, Linus calls
- **Flop (K♦7♥2♣):** Rock bets pot ($2,130), Linus calls
- **Turn (K♣):** Rock checks, Linus bets $3,195 (half pot), Rock check-raises to $6,390, Linus calls
- **River (9♣):** Rock shoves for $9,491, Linus calls
- **Showdown:** Rock shows A♣K♠, Linus shows K♥T♦

"Linus goes 2.8x iso size and you can go any size you want here because when someone limps. We're kind of off the theory tree and the rock three bets, and let's talk about ranges. So when I imagine Linus isolating, I try to think of it like this. Well, which hands would you have? Right? And the core is something around what you would raise in the cutoff. That's generally speaking the core of an isolating range, right? Which is I guess roughly this maybe this. And if you go wider or narrower, it depends on you and depends on the other guy."

"I would be very surprised if Linus had ten three suited, since that's not even an open from the button or Ace four offsuit since that's a bottom of the open. And the guy limping is another range there. So this would be as wide as you can go and there's a decent chance. Linus is a bit narrower, but definitely all the top hands are in there."

"Once the other guy limps and throws in a reraise, I'm kind of putting him on a similar type of range and that, you know, this could be value or bluffs. Of course we'd say Aces, Kings, Queens and hands like that. Let's kind of define the core of the limp-reraising range of something like this and then kind of anything else could be in there."

"And that makes hand reading a nightmare, right? Like what if he's doing this? And the answer to this is, and this is the hand reading exercise that the other guy can always have at least preflop. There's gonna be a lot of noise. But the core is this, this is the core of his range. Just like the core of Linus's isolating range. It might be much wider, but we'd say the core of the isolating range is something like this."

"So Linus calls now the core of his range once he ISOs and calls are suited connectors, suited aces, suited Broadways, that's the calling range against three bets everywhere across the world."

"Okay, so King seven deuce rainbow and they all pot bets. Does pot betting narrow his range? The first question you should ask, and if we said his range could have these hands plus some other stuff, the other stuff is still in there. Pocket Queens and pocket Kings are probably no longer in there. Very few people would pot Queens, it would be a big mistake to very few people would pot Kings. So the hand reading assumption would be there's no Queens, no Kings, Aces, Ace King and some noise right. Linus calls."

"Now we've narrowed down Linus's range. So if before we had Linus's range as pocket pairs, suited connectors, suited Broadways. Now he called a pot bet. So the pocket pairs are mostly folding to that of course. He could still have his suited Kings, maybe he'll call some suited sevens. Maybe he slow played Aces. Sometimes Linus's range is already narrowed. So, so much due to this first bet. And this is very important to understand and you might question like could he have a Queen of diamonds? I dunno, I dunno where he draws the edge. But this is the core of Linus's range."

"Okay, so turn King now if the rock had Aces barrel off less good. So his value range is mostly Ace King plus noise and his bluffs are still bluffs. If you look at Linus's hands is 6-7, 7-8, A-7, 8-7 got very, very devalued because they no longer have as many outs against the King. Whereas his trips became much stronger and the rock checks."

"And now from a hand reading perspective I would say either is trapping, but that's always negligible. The core of his checking range is Aces and give up. Okay? And so Linus goes half pot which give up are now gonna fold. Aces are gonna fold and the rock actually goes check-raise and check-raise is weird. I wouldn't expect Aces to do that. I wouldn't expect give up to do that. So I'm kind of seeing trips at this point and this feels like the Ace King trap. That's the story he's telling from a hand reading perspective."

"And you can try to think what is he bluffing with maybe turns the flush draw. But really this is, it's such a non-intuitive spot to bluff. It's just gonna be a King. Linus calls. He probably has a King and now the rock shoves with a King and Linus calls with his King, I'm assuming haven't seen results but yeah a King. King, okay, so this is a hand reading exercise and you guys could see I was able to kind of say that the rock would have a King from the second he reraised. But before that I didn't put that very much in his range. I could tell Linus has a King once he called the turn raise."

"And so it's kind of a weird spot, right? Where Linus has trips, how can he fold the river? But if you follow the hand reading exercise and you say well he only gets to the river with trips and you can fold some of them. Now the interesting thing is preflop, if we look back and we ask what did Linus isolate with this hand fits the wider range scenario we discussed. So more like a cutoff opening range and calling a three bet with it is definitely on the wide side. But you know, there's a reason Linus is the best in the world and I'm sure he always has an edge everything he plays."

### Hand 2: Flushy (SB) vs Linus (BB) - Blind Battle

**Stakes: $50/$100, $17,000 effective**

- **Preflop:** Flushy limps SB, Linus raises to $350 from BB, Flushy 3-bets to $1,600, Linus calls
- **Flop (7♣A♣Q♠):** Flushy bets $768, Linus calls
- **Turn (3♣):** Flushy checks, Linus bets $2,368 (half pot), Flushy calls
- **River (7♥):** Flushy checks, Linus shoves for $12,310, Flushy calls
- **Showdown:** Flushy shows A♦7♦, Linus shows A♥Q♦

"Here we have Asian Flushy and Linus Loeliger, two of the best players in the world, Asian Flushy limps, BvB. So in terms of range, that's a very, very wide range, but it's more bottom to middling than top heavy until he tells us otherwise. Linus raises, that's you know, top hands plus some other stuff and Asian Flushy throws in the three bet."

"And now we can start preflop ranging them assuming Linus is gonna call. Okay, so what calls a three bet pocket pairs roughly speaking right guys, no nitpicking pocket pair suited, connector suited Broadways, maybe some of the offsuit stuff, maybe some of these wheel Aces, this is in your head. What you should be visualizing is the range it calls a three bet."

"Sometimes the pairs are the suited connectors fold, sometimes ten eight or king nine make it in there. Or Ace King, Ace Queen, Kings Queen generally not in there. So it's mostly four bet. So this is the calling range, the three betting range is the same but you take out a lot of the bottom actually you leave in these so it's a bit similar here. And you add in these. So you basically take out the bottom pairs, add in the top pairs and take out say some of the bottom suited stuff, add in the top ones."

"So a Queen seven two-tone Flushy bets small, small bets don't filter your range. So he still has the full range but they do filter. Linus's range. So Linus we would now expect to be folding not a ton of hands but a lot of hearts, two hearts, two diamonds, like eight, nine of hearts, six five of hearts, some of his lower pocket pairs. So the range definitely gets a bit filtered, right? Ten nine of hearts no business continuing but still both ranges very wide, three of clubs."

"So flush comes in. Who has more suited hands? Generally Linus because he already folded a bunch, whereas Flushy still has everything and also more of his ranges suited generally. So Flushy checks, Linus bets half pot. And if we were to say what's not in his range when he bets half pot, probably no King, Queen of hearts anymore. So this is mostly gonna be bluffs or a good Ace or a flush and not so much, you know, pocket Jacks or Queen Jack of hearts, those type of hands. So the middle part kind of goes away, Flushy calls."

"So again, he could still have flushes, good top pairs sets like there's plenty of stuff he could still have what goes away, just the weaker parts of his range. Seven of hearts river. And here is where hand reading really comes in handy because ask yourselves, can Flushy have a seven? And the answer is unless we're counting a seven suited, no he can't because it's not strong enough to check call the turn."

"And so from a hand reading perspective, plus he can't really have a seven, can Linus have a seven? Maybe because a seven is kind of a bluff hand strength on the turn, but not very often because if we think of the ranges, it's just 6-7, 7-8 suited. So the seven is kind of a brick. Very important to recognize that. So Flushy checks, Linus goes all in. Now hand reading wise, Linus is basically saying he has a flush that's called."

"And let's look at the hands so Flushy, he did have a seven easy call for him and Linus actually had a Queen. Now I said he has a flush. A Queen is what's known as a thin value bet. He thinks he's gonna win often enough, but he knows sometimes he gets called and loses. It's not as 'I have a flush'. A flush. I would've thought that this is too thin. But you know, it depends on your opponent and Linus definitely knows better than me and probably any other are very wins a stack. So yeah, nice bet. Hopefully the hand reading there makes sense and is a bit helpful. And let's look at some smaller pots in the next one."

### Hand 3: Linus (LJ) vs Kayhan (BB) - UTG vs BB

**Stakes: $50/$100**

- **Preflop:** Linus raises to $220 from LJ, Kayhan calls from BB
- **Flop (A♠T♠7♦):** Kayhan checks, Linus bets pot ($490 into $490), Kayhan calls
- **Turn (5♦):** Kayhan checks, Linus overbets $2,100 into $1,470, Kayhan calls
- **River (3♥):** Kayhan checks, Linus shoves for $18,000, Kayhan folds
- **Result:** Linus shows 5♥5♠

"And this one Linus raises under the gun. He gets called by Kayhan. So two very strong players, Ace Ten seven two-tone and Linus pot bets the flop. Now when he pot bets, the hands that kind of disappear from his range mostly are hands like Kings Queen. The center of this range is gonna be something like Ace King, Ace Queen, and then there's gonna be bluffs all over the place, right?"

"Three pot gets called turn five out of the diamonds Kayhan checks and Linus overbets. So now there's no Ace, Ace Deuce, it's like good Ace or better plus bluffs Kayhan calling on a board with two flush draws. So he could have two diamonds, two spades, many combinations of those, some Ace X and it's safe to assume he would fold the other pairs at this point. But remember he could still have a Ten by virtue of having something like ten nine of diamonds or a 7, 7-8 spades type of hands."

"So three on the river and here if we're hand reading we say well Kayhan has a lot of Ten x of diamonds, Seven x of spades, Five x of spades, Ace X of diamonds. He's gonna have a lot of weak pairs here. It's not gonna be easy for him to call on the river. He checks Linus goes all in for three times the pot on Kayhan, lays it down and Linus had pocket fives."

"In terms of again, what's Linus representing going all in three times the pot on the river, I'd say better than a King, a King is probably not good enough at that point anymore. So if Kayhan even has a King himself, he might consider folding fives I think makes perfect sense for Linus start to finish. He turned it into a bluff on the flop, right? He's from a tight position, three high cards so he pots with it and then just hit the miracle five and kept going."

"So this is a way high stakes players often play pocket pairs but there are nuances to it. So in order for you guys not to pocket catch this too hard, I would say in order to turn a pocket pair into a bluff like this, generally speaking the two ingredients you want are A tight positions and B, multiple high cards on the board."

"And I would be, let's say a bit careful doing this, if you think about like Linus is bluffing with fives is what about deuces threes, fours. Then while under the gun you're not supposed to open deuces threes, fours very often. So this is like his lowest pair and Linus is well aware of those things, but it's easy to make mistakes when you're less proficient."

"So definitely not an important aspect of strategy to have as you're starting out. But if you feel like you like these kind of things, then the idea is when the pair isn't worth very much, just kind of blast off with close your eyes and blast off with it. Can't be too bad."

### Hand 4: Kevin (LJ) vs Linus (BU) - Position Battle

**Stakes: $50/$100, $10,000 effective**

- **Preflop:** Kevin raises to $300 from LJ, Linus calls from BU
- **Flop (Q♣J♠6♥):** Kevin checks, Linus bets $375, Kevin calls
- **Turn (K♦):** Kevin checks, Linus bets $1,095, Kevin calls
- **River (5♥):** Kevin checks, Linus bets pot ($3,690 into $3,690), Kevin folds
- **Result:** Linus shows A♣T♣ (nuts)

"Another example here Kevin raises under the gun Linus called on the button ranges. Kevin has the under the gun raising range and Linus. So a cold calling range is similar to a call versus three-bet range. So Linus is gonna be pocket pair suited, connector suited, Broadways the best offsuit stuff and that's it. That's the range we're imagining."

"Now important to note, the rocks are the only non pro at the table is sitting in the big blind. That generally makes pros play slightly wider ranges and that's something we recommend here as well. So Queen Jack six Rainbow. Kevin checks no information yet 'cause he is out of position. He's supposed to defend his checking range. If he were a weaker regular, we'd take out a lot of the stronger hands in his range, but against the stronger guys they would actually check some pretty strong stuff here."

"So we check calls. Now I'd say Kevin has a Queen, a Jack, a Six for some kind of gutshot, whereas Linus could still have anything for a half pocket bet. Likely not pocket Ten, pocket Nine, likely not Jack, but maybe some Jacks and yeah, anything could bluff. So Linus, his range as the aggressor, very wide King on the turn."

"Kevin checks. Can Kevin improve on the King? Yes, he could improve to Ten Nine, Ace Ten, King Jack, King, Queen, all those hands still in his range. Linus keeps firing. Now again, we can narrow down this range and say, well let's say he has King Ten or better for value plus bluffs. Don't expect him to be betting with a Queen or a Jack anymore. And then Kevin should continue with any King or better."

"And the rest of the hands depends, but probably Jack Ten, Queen Ten continue something like Jack Eight suited probably folds. He decides to call river five. He checks Linus goes for a pot size bet. So now Linus isn't doing this with King Ten anymore. Let's do a hand reading exercise. Can Kevin still have King Jack King Queen or would he check raise the turn?"

"Well, given the board has all these straights with Ace Ten and Ten Nine, I think he's very likely to still have King Jack, King Queen. And so for Linus to pot bet the river, let's say he needs Sixes or better roughly maybe King, Queen or better, that's kind of the range we assign him. And Kevin's gonna have a bunch of hands that just have a tough decision here. He decides to fold. Then Linus had Ace Ten for the nut straight."

## Key Takeaways

The video demonstrates several important hand reading principles:

1. **Range Construction:** Start with position-based ranges and narrow them with each action
2. **Core vs Noise:** Focus on the core of ranges while acknowledging noise exists
3. **Bet Sizing Tells:** Large bets narrow ranges significantly, small bets don't filter much
4. **Turn/River Cards:** Evaluate how new cards interact with both ranges
5. **Exploitative Adjustments:** Recreational players have different ranging patterns than pros
