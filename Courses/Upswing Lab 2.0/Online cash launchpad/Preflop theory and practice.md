The solver prefers to use blocker hands like A7o when opening over implied odds hands because it relies on fold equity. In lower stakes people call a lot, so I want to play playable hands like pocket pairs/suited connectors more than I want to play blocker hands

Same thing for 3-bet: It bets polar relying on fold equity. I have less fold equity so I want to 3-bet playable and linear range:
99+,ATs+,AQ+,KJs,KTs,KQs almost always
and expand it to 66-88,A3s-A5s,QTs,QJs,JTs,AJo,KQo against weaker opponents.

As BB vs a 4BB open - I want to play really tight, and fold strong hands like AJo/ATo(!) vs an early open to a bigger size

I can make up for defending tight (which will make me look like a nit) by opening wider from later positions, and 3-betting aggressively

Tight-aggressive is a good strategy in these games (live,online micros)
