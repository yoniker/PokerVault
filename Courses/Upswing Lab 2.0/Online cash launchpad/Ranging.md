# Ranging Strategy Video - Complete Transcript

## Core Concepts

"Hey guys, welcome to this video on ranging. Ranging is the idea that we can put a player on a set of hands, which they can have. As a hand progresses you can narrow this range further and further down. This is really important because the general approach to good strategic poker, it's to think about which hands we have, think about which hands our opponent have and come up with a strategy based on this. Ranging is one of the most important skills in poker because, at the core, you need to understand how the ranges work in order to come up with a good strategy."

"The way I like to think about ranges is in two parts. I like to think of ranges as having core hands. Core hands are the hands that make up the bulk of the range, and these hands tend to have a preference to go in a certain line. We also have supplementary hands. Supplementary hands are hands that kind of round out the strategy, so it's not too heavy in one direction and doesn't have any really clear imbalances."

"A good example of these would be, when we're building a betting range, we have the core hands, which are our value hands, which we clearly want to build the pot with, and we supplement that with a bunch of bluffs. Otherwise, when we bet, our opponent could always fold if they don't have a hand which beats our value bets. When thinking about the ranges in game, we want to mostly think about the core hands, and that's because the core of each range kind of designates what sort of strategy should be played."

"I'll do some hand examples now and that should make these ideas a bit clearer."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: 6♠4♠ in Big Blind vs Button

- **Preflop:** Button opens 2.5x, Hero calls from BB with 6♠4♠
- **Flop (T♣A♠4♥):** Hero checks, Button bets 33% pot, Hero calls
- **Turn (2♠):** Check/check
- **River (T♥):** Hero checks, Button bets 75% pot, Hero calls
- **Showdown:** Button shows T♦7♦

"So this first hand I have Six Four suited in the big blind and the first action we face is this 2.5x from the button. Now, as soon as we face the next street we want to think about which range of hands make sense for this. Now, when they open the button, they're generally going to open a range which is roughly forty-five percent or so. So we can already narrow the range to the top sort of forty-five percent of hands."

"When I call in the big blind, this also narrows my range. First of all, I don't have any of the very best hands, because they'd be three betting preflop. So hands like Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, Tens, for example, will never be calling here. We're also three betting most of our other fairly strong hands, like Ace King will always three bet, et cetera. So I don't have the very top hands, but I also don't have the very worst hands because I need a decent hand to be able to call this open-raise. So I'm thinking my range has got lots of middling hands, decent hands, whereas the other player has the top sort of forty percent of hands."

"Now we check and face a small c-bet. When players bet small like this, this doesn't really narrow their range at all. A lot of players who will use this sizing will just be betting a hundred percent of their hands. So this doesn't alter his range at all."

"Now, when I call here, we can already narrow my range a lot and start to give my range like a core. When I just call, I don't tend to have the very strongest hands very often. I'll mostly be raising my Ace Ten, my pocket Fours and I don't have Aces or Tens preflop. So my range is core now, is lots of Ace x, lots of Ten x, lots of Four x and lots of under pairs. So pockets, say, Eights through Twos we'll be calling this. And then I also have some draws."

"Now on the Two, this is a pretty bricky card, some straights get in, but I often check-raise Five Three and he only has suited combos. So pretty much just a brick. We don't have any leads here, so our range is the same as it was on the flop. And in position decides to check back."

"Now, this narrows their range quite a lot too. When they check back here, they will no longer have the really strong hands in their range. Hands like Ace Jack and better here will pretty much always barrel on the turn. This means I can start to designate a core to their range, and that's going to start with hands like Ace Nine to Ace Three, so lots of weaker Ace X. They'll then have lots of Ten x, lots of pocket pairs, lots of Fours, and they'll have quite a lot of air too. So I'm immediately thinking their hand is more showdown based when they check back on the turn."

"We get the river Ten. Ten is a pretty interesting river here because it improves both of our ranges a lot. Now, both players have a lot of trips here, which means in general we'll use pretty small sizings for both players."

"Now, if we think about the core of my range, the core of my range was lots of weaker Ace X, lots of Four x and lots of Ten x as well as some bluffy sort of hands at this point. We also have the pocket pairs, pocket Fives through pocket Eights a lot. And if we think about their range, the core of my range wants to check. So Four x can't bet, any Twos we have can't bet, or the pocket pairs can't bet. Even a weak Ace x doesn't really want to bet or if it does, it only wants to bet very small."

"That means the core of my range is going to be checking and we'll use our Ten x to supplement the checking range. That's because if we never check the Ten, in position could just bet really big with their own Ace x and really put our hands in a really rough spot. So I decide to check here, which I should always do with a Four and we face a seventy-five percent pot bet from in position."

"This bet is reflecting that he has the core of my range beat. So this is pretty much saying he's got a hand that beats all my pocket pairs and maybe beats a weak Ace two. So I'm immediately thinking this is probably something like Ace Five and better for in position. So the range is going to be lots of Ten x and then Ace Five through Ace Nine. In order to supplement that range, he'll need to be bluffing and he's got all sorts of air which he can pick from to bluff."

"So given he's value betting Ace X and better, as out of position we'll call any of our Aces and hands weaker than an Ace will be indifferent. And I decide to bluffcatch this time. We do see that he's got a Ten, which is right in the core of his range, so that's to be expected."

### Hand 2: Pocket Nines from Hijack

- **Preflop:** Hero opens from HJ with 9♦9♠, BB calls
- **Flop (5♥5♠3♠):** BB checks, Hero bets 33% pot, BB calls
- **Turn (Q♥):** BB checks, Hero bets 75% pot, BB calls
- **River (4♣):** Check/check
- **Showdown:** BB shows A♦Q♠

"In this next one I have pocket Nines in the hijack and I open. And we get defended by the big blind. Again, this will have a similar dynamic where I have the top sort of twenty to twenty-five percent of hands, and the big blind has this sort of more middling range where they don't have their very best hands. And they have a bit of a wider range because they get odds preflop."

"On the Five Five Three flop, this favors out of position a decent amount, they have more Five x than we do. That being said, my range has more equity in general because I'm opening a tighter range and I have all the best over pairs still. So I don't get to bet all my hands here, but I can build a decent c-betting range, and pocket Nines will get in there a lot."

"When I do c-bet, it does actually narrow my range a bit here because I'm not betting all my hands. The main hands that don't like to c-bet are hands which are strong overcards, which really don't want to face a check-raise. So something like maybe King Jack, or Ace Ten, Ace Nine, tend to not really like betting here so often. Because when we c-bet we always get called by better hands. We don't get called by many worse hands. And if we face a raise we're in a really awkward situation. So those are the hands which will go into the check back more often. But in general we can bet most of our hands with the small sizing at some frequency."

"Now, when our opponent calls we can narrow his range a lot too. When he has got a big advantage on a Five x, he'll often be raising with his Five on the flop. This means that most of his check calling hands are hands like Ace highs, so have Ace Queen, Ace Jack, Ace Ten, Ace Nine. He also have hands like King Queen, King Jack, various backdoor hands and some straight draws, some Three x and some pocket pairs."

"On the Queen turn we need to think about how that interacts with the ranges and actually hits both players a decent amount. Out of position has Ace Queen a lot, and they have King Queen a lot, so they improved some pretty strong hands. But in the scheme of their whole range it doesn't make up a massive portion. So a hand like pocket Nines is still pretty good when you consider that out of position has lots of Three x and lots of pocket pairs."

"So it's important to think about how much of the range the Queen X makes up, because that kind of tells us how much our hands are worth. In this situation the Queens that he does have are offsuited, and offsuited hands make up three times as many combos as suited hands. It's an important part of ranging because the offsuit combos make up significantly more combos, so when they connect they make up a decent portion of their ranges."

"So given the out of position player has King Queen always and Ace Queen always here, this is probably a pretty good card for them. Now we also c-bet a bunch of Queen X, so it's not terrible for us, but this turn does devalue hands like say pocket Sixes, which could probably value bet if this turn was, say a Nine."

"So on the turn I face a check and in position I decide to barrel again. I think Nines does well enough versus this range. I think they still have a lot of Ace highs, they have a lot of Three x and they have a lot of worse pocket pairs. So I think this hand can value bet on the turn."

## Solver Analysis

"Given this is a little bit of a complicated one to evaluate how much of their range has this Queen x, I'm actually going to have a quick look in the solver to get a nice visualization of this. So we see here the big blind defend range. Again, they don't have any of the top hands and they've got a slightly wider range than us because they get good odds preflop. And my range looks something like this."

"As I mentioned, hands like King Queen really don't like c-betting... Ace Nine, Ace Eight. So they tend to check back more often. But every hand of the range kind of can c-bet. So we can't narrow the range a lot on the flop. When we c-bet, out of position calls pretty wide with Ace highs and high card hands, and they're check-raising a lot with their pairs and their Fives."

"Now on the turn we see the top pair now makes up fifteen percent of the ranges. So based on these twelve combos of King Queen and these twelve combos of Ace Queen, this actually now makes up a major part of the in position range. So this is going to slow us down a lot as in position with our marginal value bets. We see here a hand like pocket Nines does really like to barrel, but it's almost too thin. We see a hand like pocket Sixes is too thin here."

"Now if we weren't as aware of the ranges and how the other player can have King Queen and Ace Queen here, it would be really easy to bet too thin. For example, on something like a Nine turn, I think it's actually quite reasonable to bet down to pocket Sixes, just because the Nine hits far less of the out of position flop check calls. We see here on the Nine turn, we can bet down to pocket Fours even for value. That's because we're aware of how the ranges interact and the Nine doesn't make out of position too many top pairs. We see here top pair is just nine percent of the range now, compared with the fifteen percent on the Queen."

"So immediately we see here the value of ranging and being aware of how the Queen interacts with the ranges and how that should drive our strategy. So we c-bet our Nines on the turn and get called. We see this as a good play, but it's more marginal than if the turn was lower."

"And on the river Four we need to think again, how does this interact with the ranges? Well, it brings in straights, but straights are very, very, very uncommon here. So much of the ranges is made up of pocket pairs and Queen X that this is almost just like a brick. Now, given lots of the range is a Queen X, we probably need a good Queen or better to value bet the river here. So a hand like pocket Kings can clearly barrel. I think Ace Queen can still bet for value, but once you get away from there I think it's going to be pretty marginal to value bet. So I have a check behind on the river and we run into Ace Queen."

## Key Takeaways

"I hope these examples made it a bit clearer of how I like to range. Everyone does this a little bit differently, but personally I think by thinking in cores of ranges it really simplifies the ranging process. I think it's pretty easy to get lost in the weeds if you try... range very, very explicitly. But if you are thinking more about hand classes and roughly which cards hit and which don't, it's much easier to get a clear picture of the strategies we should be playing."

"What's really important also is to narrow the ranges after each action. So for example, if we go to this paired board, the difference in the check back range on say a Nine, where our check back range is almost exclusively Ace highs compared with the Queen, where our check back range has lots of pocket pairs involved as well as the Ace highs, and even some top pairs, being aware of how the strategies play is really important."

"So yeah, it's important to be very aware of how the ranges narrow after each action, and the only way to do this is be very, very conscious of how the ranges look and what the cores of the ranges want to be doing."

## Exploitative Adjustments

"Now, we can also add some exploitative thoughts to these processes. A good example would be facing three bets. In theory there's a set three bet range that the solver likes to use, but in practice we face all sorts of different opponents. Some players are three betting only Ace King and Aces and Kings pre. Versus these players our strategy is going to look a lot different both preflop and postflop, and we just have to designate them a fairly reasonable range."

"It's also important to be flexible postflop. Say we're against someone who really likes to overplay their hands, maybe they like to bet all their pairs. That means you need to treat both, the betting range as having a core of lots of pairs, but also the checking range as missing lots of pairs because they're putting them into a different action. So again, it's really important to narrow the ranges according to how our opponents are playing."

"I hope this was interesting and I'll go more in depth in this when I talk about how we want to evaluate how much our hands are worth. Thanks."
