My summary:
As OOP player I need to trap sometimes because if I don't then IP will be able to always navigate his hand to the pot size that he wants.
As IP player, on boards where the turn will improve my range (for example on Q83, some 9/T/J will give me a straight sometimes when I infrequently check the gutshots) or a 7/6/5 will give me a set sometimes, so I don't need to slowplay top of my range.
On board where I won't improve often, for example monotone boards, I need to slowplay sometimes in order for the OOP not to run me down on the turn/river where I can't have nutted hands if I always bet the flop.

# In Position vs Out of Position Play - Coaching Transcript

## Core Concepts

"Hey Guys! Welcome to this video. This one I'm going to be talking about the main differences between playing in position and out of position as the aggressor."

## Playing the Top of Range

### Out of Position Strategy

"The first major difference I want to talk about is playing the top of our range. As out of position, if we check, the in position player has the opportunity to bet. What this means is on the flop we need to check some of our strongest hands to help protect our checking range. By checking some of our strongest hands, we can also build a check-raising range. This punishes in position from stabbing marginal hands."

"And if we never check-raise, in position kind of gets to build the pot exactly how they would like. So if we never check-raise it's really easy to play against us because in position can just play their hand exactly like they want, put in exactly the right amount of money. By adding check-raises to our strategy, we're much tougher to play against."

"And by limiting how much in position can stab our marginal hands realize the equity much, much better."

### In Position Strategy

"In contrast, as in position, if we check, we see the turn immediately. This means that we don't necessarily need to trap very strong hands on the flop in order to protect our range, but we can instead check a range which improves on all the runouts. This means that we bet a majority of our strongest hands on the flop and our check range improves enough on different turns that we're not too worried about getting attacked a lot because we'll always improve to some good hands."

### Monotone Board Exception

"Now there are some certain situations where our range doesn't improve enough on certain runouts. An example of this would be like a monotone board. On a monotone board, there's already flushes on the flop and on most turns flushes will still be the nuts on the turn. What this means is that if we never check a flush, out of position can go just crazy against us."

"What this means is if we never trap on the flop, out of position can just go really crazy against us. And even though we improved some two pairs on the turn, that doesn't stop out of position just piling in tons and tons of money. So on these textures where the nuts don't change on turns, we do need a trap as in position of the flop."

### Solver Examples - Trapping

"To show these ideas better I'll show a couple of sims in Lucid to show the differences. The first spot I want to look at is blind versus blind, where we opened 3x and the big blind called. And say we get a board like Queen Eight Three rainbow."

"If we look over to the right here, we see that all of the hands in the range are mixing in checks. So our sets are checking sometimes, our two pairs are checking sometimes, our overpairs, top pairs, et cetera, et cetera. So we like to check all sorts of hands on the flop because when we do check, we still face a bet fairly often, so it's not like we're missing out on value."

"Now if we do face the bet, we get to leverage these hands to often check-raise. By check-raising it means that hands like Nine Eight on the flop for in position get really punished for stabbing. Now in an ideal world, these hands would bet small on the flop, get folds from all sorts of overcards, deny some equity and then check down. But if we trap on the flop, we then have some strong hands which allow us to build a raising range, which also allows us to bluff. So we really punish players from stabbing these marginal hands if we decide to trap some of our best hands."

"Now, if we can compare this to button versus big blind where we are the in position aggressor, we see that the very best hands in our range are really trapping. We see our sets never trap. We see our two pairs barely ever trap and our overpairs barely ever trap either."

"Now, the reason for this is, again, because we can improve on all different runouts. If we look at where the most common parts of the range are green, we see that there's Twos, Fours, Fives, Sixes, Sevens. So on any of those cards, we make some sets on the turn. This protects our range. We also check back straight draws at a certain frequency. So on any of the straight completers we improve. We then check back some Ace highs and King highs. So we always make good top pairs along with some two pairs from hands like say King Queen. So on every turn we'll always pick up some very strong hands, which means we don't need to trap immediately on the flop."

"Now, an example I mentioned where we do need to trap on the flop is a monotone board. Now again, this is because on, say, a Seven of hearts, if we never checked back a flush, the strongest hand we can have is a hand like pocket Sevens, which means all of out of position's flushes can just overbet turn and shove river and put our whole range in a really tough spot."

"What this means is we see that solver very often traps even as the in position player on these sorts of textures. We see here that flushes are checking back forty percent of the time."

"This is the first major difference between playing in position and out of position. As out of position we always want to have some traps in our checking range because they allow us to check-raise and as in position we usually bet all of our best hands unless there's some very clear nutted hands which don't change on turns."

## Draw Play on the Turn

### Out of Position Draw Strategy

"The next hand type I want to talk about is draws on the turn. As out of position our decent draws which can't win at showdown tend to like playing aggressively. This is because check-folding a decent draw is like a pretty big waste of equity. When we have a draw, we can win even against the strongest hands in our opponent's range. So check-folding is a waste of equity, but check-calling when you can't win at showdown also isn't a very good option because we even lose to some of the bluffs if they give up on the river."

"This means that as out of position, when we have a draw which can't win at showdown, and has a decent amount of equity, we usually want to play it aggressively, either by betting or check-raising. Now, there are some situations where we have so many draws in our range that we do just have to check fold some of them. Otherwise we have way too many bluffs. In general in these cases we want to just check-fold the lowest equity draws."

### In Position Draw Strategy

"Now, as in position, when we check back we immediately see the river. This means that checking back with these draws that can't win at showdown is a much more reasonable option because we're not wasting our equity by checking. What this means is we mix bets and checks in position, but as out of position we tend to bet most of our draws."

"Now, a little added consequence of this is that draws take up less room in our bluffing range. This kind of frees up space for some lower equity bluffs. So what this means is often the in position players will be bluffing some really weak hands because there's extra space in the bluffing range. And what I mean by this is for every value bet you want one to one bluff ratio or something on the turn, and if we're betting less draws, it means there's more room for other hand types."

"Good general rule is that as the out of position player, we want equity to bluff, but as in position we actually don't need equity to bluff always."

### Solver Examples - Draws

"I'll again show some sims in Lucid to get this idea across. Again, I'll jump into the out of position player first and we'll again go to blind versus blind where there's a 3x and a call. On the flop, I've got the Queen Nine Three rainbow. Out position bets at a very high frequency and in position calls. Now, say we get a Two of hearts turn."

"The hands we want to focus on here are the draws. The immediate draws that jump to mind here are hands like Five Four, Six Five and Six Four. We see these hands are primarily betting and when they do check and face a stab, we see that they're primarily check-raising, especially the high equity draws. So we see a hand like Five Four is never check-calling, it's never check folding. It's either check-raising, which is this node, or it's betting on the turn itself."

"Now, as I mentioned, when there are a lot of draws on board, you do just have to give up some, and this is a board where that is the case. There's all the Ten Eights, there's all the Jack Eights, King Tens, King Jacks, et cetera. So there's so many draws here that we do just have to give up some. But for our decent draws, the only options we want to take are aggressive ones."

"Now, the same will go with flush draws. So looking over to the right here, we're focusing on the heart combos. These hands are primarily just betting on the turn when they don't have showdown, but as soon as there a draw which does have some showdown value, say Ace Eight of hearts, we can start to check-call it, because it's no longer wasting its equity. We'll see something similar with Jack Ten. Jack Ten is primarily betting on the turn. But if we do check and face a bet, we do check-call some of the time, but we're also mostly playing it aggressively."

"Now, to contrast this I want to again go to the in position player version and I'll go to button versus big blind on the Queen Nine Three. We check and we c-bet small with most of our range and get called. And again, I'll go to the Two of heart's turn."

"Here we see a much clearer split where all of the draws are mixing on the turn. We see that Jack Ten can bet or check. We see that Five Four is mostly checking on the turn, Six Five, Six Four, mostly checking. And all of these low flush draws are mixing. So these hands like Eight Six and Eight Seven, were pretty much pure betting as the out of position player. But here as in position, checking back is a very real opportunity."

"And we never can face the raise, so we always realize our equity if we check back, whereas we actually re-open the action by betting and that makes them more likely that we face this low frequency raise and our hand just gets denied its equity, like Seven Six does here."

"So as the in position player, checking back with draws is a very real option and as I mentioned, this frees up some space in the bluffing range. That's why here we see hands like King Four, King Five, King Six, without a draw betting very often. These are like a top pair draw, they have a few outs, but given all of the bluffing spaces aren't taken up by the draws, there's more room for hands like this."

"Whereas if we go back to this blind versus blind example, so many of the draws on the turn are betting that there's not room for trashy hands to be betting on the turn. So we see that it's very rare to see these very weak hands betting on the turn. These are gutshots, but the Ace Six, the Ace Seven aren't betting, these King highs aren't betting."

"So yeah, this is a very common pattern where the in position player doesn't need equity to bluff, but the out of position player does need equity to bluff."

## River Betting Dynamics

### In Position River Play

"The final point I want to talk about is betting thin on rivers. As the in position on the river, when we bet we re-open the action because by betting we re-open the action and this means the out of position gets the opportunity to put more money in than we would like."

"What this tends to mean is that for the in position player, it doesn't tend to make sense to re-open the action for small sizes. That's because if, say we bet one big blind into a ten big blind pot, we're re-opening the action so the other player can build a massive pot, but we only get one big blind of value from a weak hand that bets that sizing."

"This means that it's very rarely worth re-opening for a small size as the in position player because the cost to re-opening the action is simply too great. As a general rule, we don't want to bet smaller than half pot on rivers in position because it's not worth re-opening the action."

"There are a few exceptions here, like some spots like a four straight board where both players have tons and tons of straights, but in general you never need to bet smaller than half the pot on rivers. I use this as a strict draw myself in game."

### Out of Position River Play

"Now, as out of position, when we check, we don't immediately see showdown. That's because in position can always bet versus our checks. What this means is that there isn't this added cost to betting as the out of position player and it makes more sense to bet for very small sizes."

"This means that there's not an added cost to betting as the out of position player and we can go for thinner value bets for small sizes. These are often referred to as block bets."

### Solver Examples - River Sizing

"So in order to show this point, I'm going to look at, again, big blind versus button single raised pot, where in position c-bets small on the flop and gets called, and then we get the Four of diamonds turn. Now I've rerun this tree, so there's just one size on the turn and I want to focus on the check back line."

"Now what's special about the sim is I've added tons and tons of sizings to the solver and run it to a very high accuracy so we get a good idea of exactly how it likes to play."

"Now, for the out of position player, we're seeing it used every size pretty much, we're seeing it bet one big blind with some very weak hands. We then see a quarter pot sizing, a half pot sizing. Lots of small sizing because there's no cost to re-opening the pot. When they check we can bet ourselves. So there's not this added cost."

"Now, if out of position checks, we see the in position player clearly doesn't like using these very small sizes. The reason for this is, if say we bet one big blind here, we're allowing out of position to shove with their pockets, which is insane, but we're just giving the out of position an opportunity to make the pot the size they want. And best case is that we get one extra big blind versus an Ace."

"So a hand like pocket Sevens, which would be the hand strength that wants to bet that sizing, simply prefers to just take showdown. We even see some pretty strong hands like pocket Nines or a Ten checking back sometimes because re-opening the action and getting check-raised by hands like these Eight x, simply isn't worth it and instead they prefer to take showdown."

## Key Takeaways

"So this is the really important idea on rivers and that is that there is a cost to re-opening the action as the in position player. This means we generally don't want to re-open for very small sizes. The rule I use is never re-open as the in position player for less than half pot."

"As out of position, we are much less limited because when we check our opponent can bet anyway. So it makes sense to kind of bet your hand more what it's worth as the out of position player, specifically when you have a nut advantage. We'll go into this more in other parts of the video."

"I hope this was interesting. Thanks."
