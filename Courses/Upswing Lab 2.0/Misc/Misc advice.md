In a spot where solver calls more than a human would overfold compared to solver(for example, on QT64r, vs a 160% pot,if a solver calls T2/T3 and any Q, plus AJ, and humans fold,) it's a very nice spot to bet.

In a draw-heavy board, if a weaker villian bets small, it's with a weaker range. Because the way they think is "I don't want you to outdraw me".

If I see someone overbets as a bluff, he can be a "agro-warrior" type player, and I should be suspicious when he does put a lot of pressure

Mark hands and study spots where I wasn't sure how the spot plays

If I want to work on the raising range, work on the ENTIRE raising range. For example, on a monotone board, knowing that flushes raise 15% of the time is useless as flushes are such a low percentage of my overall range! It's not fine to focus on a small percentage of my raising range. Take my time and study all of it.

When I watch a poker coach, and something that he says doesn't make sense (for example, he's saying that a T on the turn is a brick when i feel that it's not), I can test this with the solver.
