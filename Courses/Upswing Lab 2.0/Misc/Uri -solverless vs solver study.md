My summary:
In solverless ep1 Uri examined sb vs bb spots, and always asked one question:
*How good is the board for OOP vs IP? What's his overall strategy?*
and then on the turn same question, how good is the board now given the turn card and actions on the flop.

With the solver, he bucketed the hands with ev and tried to make sense of it (strong hands raise,bad hands fold, mid hands bet with mid frequency, worse-than-mid-hands that are good enough to bet but will fold themselves to a bet, bet more often).
