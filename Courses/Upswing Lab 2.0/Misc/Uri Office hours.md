# Poker Coaching Q&A Transcript

## Note-Taking and Hand Analysis

Down the action in one line. And then just based on my experience, I often make a judgment call about, you know, what does this mean? If I had to tell myself something about the guy, what would I say? Some hands it's nothing, but some hands I'll write down the action and I'll also write something like, uh, "Missed an obvious bluff," right? That's what happened. And for me, I then add a passive question mark. Or took a very spewy bluff, and then I'd write, "Aggro?" Or made a big hero call, or made a big hero fold and showed, right? Like these kinds of things. Or he bet a certain sizing and it was a nuts adjust, right, the size was strong. So I'm just building, building things, um, and what I do every now and then is I delete old stuff. Um, I just suggest practicing it. As you practice it, you'll slowly get better and better at this stuff.

## Rake and Stakes Discussion

So Yoni Karen is saying the same rake at every stake of Russian cash at GG Network. That's crazy. Yeah, so you, you can play micros. I guess if it's the same rake, there's less reason not to play, um, and yeah, I, I would study whatever tool you study. Just make sure that you're focusing on, not on getting... Don't worry about small EV mistakes as you're studying. Only worry about big EV mistakes, so any hand where the solver tells you, oh, you're wrong, 0.3 big blinds in a 200 big blind pot, just ignore and say, "I played well." Like, we're shooting at, at low, at micro stakes. Uh, we want to shoot for, uh, reasonable execution rather than God-like execution.

## MDA and Hand2Note

Bimbidu is writing, "What's my opinion about MDA Hand2Note? If my goal is to compete at high stakes, is it important to know at least a bit about MDA using Hand2Note?" 

Um, so, yeah, the answer is first of all, I have never used Hand2Note, um, and I haven't used much MDA. Uh, but I know some very successful people have, and it, and I know it's part of adding to your game. So my answer here is sort of a, there are many ways to climb the same mountain. You don't have to have MDA, and you don't have to have Hand2Note, uh, but they'll probably help if, if you integrate them well. 

There is some good information there, specifically about recreational players. There is some very good information. Uh, there is also the kind of information that, that you'd never get without these tools. So one piece of information that you have in MDA is you have the reg population response to cold 4-bets, and it turns out the response is too passive. It's not that they fold too much, but they don't shove enough. They don't... People are not fans of shoving over cold 4-bets with ace, king or queens in tight positions, and so somehow the result is cold 4-bet bluffing is, is good in tight positions. And you'd never know this without MDA. Right? It's kind of a math analytical tool, and that's not for everyone. So not mandatory. 

You can just find, like, a friend or a group of friends who know MDA and, and ask them what they use. Like, in, in my coaching for-profit group, we just have an MDA guy who sometimes when we're reviewing hands, we ask him, is, is there some MDA opinion about the spot? And then he says, "Well, fish potting is, is usually strong, so just fold," or, or something like that.

## Active Learning and Questioning

Yoni, next question, um, he's saying, "Uri, we don't drill to get things right. We drill to get things wrong. Seems like you agree that active learning is great. What are great questions to ask about a spot before looking at the solver output?"

There are a bunch of, of different types of questions you want to ask yourself. Uh, let's say you're looking at the barreling button versus big blind, and you bet flop and you're on the turn and you pair the middle card. You might ask yourself, "What do I think is the size I want to be using?" And then ask, "What do I think is the weakest value hand I should bet?" And then you could ask, "Am I gonna have any slow plays?" And then you can ask, "Which bluffs am I gonna use, and is it gonna be... and what's gonna be roughly the frequency like?" Always, never, middling. 

And then you can ask questions about the other guy. Uh, "What's the weakest hand he needs to call? Does he need to find raises? Do I think this spot's gonna be over-called or over-folded?" And you can kind of keep going and keep going with these things.

## Starting Stakes and Bankroll Management

Wolf Dogs asking, "How are you supposed to get good at 15NL or 25NL when you might be losing a lot?" 

Um, I mean, I, I guess that's a fair question. Um, if you feel like... Everything depends on your finances. So if, if, if someone told me, "Look, I want to try out poker. Where should I start?" I'd probably say, "25, 50, 100NL if you can afford it. And then set yourself a bankroll of, of 30, 40 buy-ins, that... If, if you're okay with losing that amount." 

Um, and if the guy says, "No, I, I can't afford to lose 40 buy-ins at 25NL, that's $1,000. That's too significant for me," um, yeah, makes sense to play lower. Also might make sense to look for an alternate source of income than poker. I feel like if $1,000 is too... This is no, no disrespect intended, but this is, you know, we're playing a, a game with, with variance. It's a gambling... It's a betting game, let's say.

Like, when I started out poker, I deposited $600. I started playing $4 sit and goes. Straight away, I lost $250 first, first evening I, I played. And that, that's kind of how the game goes, right?

## Site Selection

Yoni, "WPT Gold is way softer compared to the global GG Poker pool." Yes. Yes. Definitely, definitely, definitely. Um, if you can play WPT Gold, then play WPT Gold. Any, any ring-fenced site this is true for. So that, there are others. I think WPT Gold for the Upswing audience is gonna be a big one most of you guys can play. So I'd, I'd jump on that opportunity. Uh, I'd play it too. All my, my students who can play it, play it. It's, uh... Yeah, just for reference, back in the day, we found a really soft site. Everyone's income went up 10X very quickly as a group of, of grinders. So the site you play is very, very significant.

## Non-Theory Lines

Nimbru saying, "How to approach spots that villain does something that's not a thing in theory. For example, if they three bet out of position PFR and skip C-bet on A7 deuce, I find it hard to put them on a range."

So in terms of how to study the spot, if you wanted to study it, you could take a solver and force it to use a bigger size, and then you'd get... If you kind of ask me in practice, what doesn't see bet on a 7-deuce rainbow, the answer is going to be pocket kings and pocket queens, right? The exact hands that have the low incentive to see bet. 

And so, uh, when someone does a not in theory thing, I just, in my head I put them on, on mostly the not in theory, you know, mostly the main hand that that makes sense for, that's very often going to be a made hand that's medium strength. Very, very often. Uh, and you can take notes. But that, that's my default assumption, that, you know, someone doesn't see bet king 10-deuce, pocket queens, pocket jacks, pocket nines, uh, 10-9, not often stronger or weaker than these kind of hands.

## Study-Play Balance

Dr. T says, "I've been studying a lot, trying a bunch of content and courses, and I always struggle with applying what I've learned to the game. How do I balance the amount of study to the amount of play? I go through this pattern of study for weeks drilling and diving into content, and by the time I get to the table, I've overwhelmed and feel like I didn't learn enough and need to stop playing until I'm ready."

You're a personality type I've encountered a lot. You're a bit of a perfectionist. Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but basically, you, you don't want to play unless you're in, in perfect shape for it. You would rather sit out and practice than play not at your 100%. And this style of personality has advantages and disadvantages. Uh, it's certainly not optimal for poker. 

Yet generally speaking, to do well in poker, you have to play a lot. Uh, you need to play... If we're talking study to play ratio, you need to play a lot more than you're studying. Um, and you need to do that, like you said, in order to integrate all the things you learn. If you learn something and then you don't play, it doesn't get integrated, and then when you sit at the table, you have four ideas which you're not sure... You know, in-game timer's ticking, the situation is a bit unique, you're not sure what to do. You need to, to have that practice all the time, all the time, all the time.

So I'd say for every hour you study, play... For, for you, I'm saying let's play for an hour. Most guys, I'd say every hour you study, play for five hours. But every hour you study, play for an hour. Just do that as a rule. Like you, you're doing poker today, play for an hour, then study for an hour, and you're not allowed to study more until you play more.

## Playing Worse After Studying

Spicy Chicken is saying, "Do you think it's normal to play worse after studying courses?" 

Um, and I'm skimming through the rest of the answer. The answer is yes. It's super normal to play worse. Uh, this has to do with how we learn stuff. So when you add in new stuff to your game, in the beginning, it's not integrated well, so you're very clumsy implementing it, and it might actually hurt you. And that's... That is part of the learning process. 

Definitely don't force yourself to apply what you've learned, and, and also kind of expect this. If you can, as you're studying a course, go through a bit and then play and be like, "Okay, I feel like this thing is integrated," you can play in a, in a trainer or something as well. But make sure it's integrated before moving on to the next thing. Don't take in 20 things and then jump into playing.

I often had students who would join my coaching for profit, Guerrilla Poker, and they would be like three BB winners before then go break even for five months, and then they'd suddenly be nine BB winners. But just all the new content it took takes a long time for things to sink in and work together. So I think that, I've seen that be very common actually.

## End Boss Players vs Average Regs

Bimbi Doo Water Three, "Most important differences between end bosses and average 500 and L regs." 

Um, okay, I have a cool answer for that question. So, um, by the way, Prodigy, Barak and Doodie are- they have different skill sets, but one thing all three of them have in common and it's usually an indicative of an end boss kind of guy. 

You know how when we play poker, say I raise a bet and you call big blind, we both have a range. Then I see that half pot you call, and then again, both of our ranges got narrowed, but you can visualize both of them. Um, and then on the turn, the board pairs and I check back, and on the river it comes some high card and it's on you. What are both of our ranges at this point? 

This is something the end bosses are extremely good at visualizing very, very accurately, right? So they know very well how big to value bet, how much they need to bluff catch, how much they get to bluff. And when someone does something that's off or doesn't make sense, they spot it very easily. So this kind of skill of being able to... I kind of think of poker as though we're playing a three-dimensional chess against each other, but the chessboard is invisible. And I feel like these guys have a good grasp of what the invisible chessboard looks like.

I had a hand with Barak where he four bets ace king against a guy, uh, and the guy check calls flop, check, check turn. The guy shoves river. It's like 20 KNL or something on an app. And I'm sweating Barak and he looks at the board and he starts counting combos and he's like, "You know, I think he has 15 bluff combos and like, I have to call this," right? Not even close. So he gets into this spot where most guys their brain would freeze facing a 13K shove when you just have ace high. And he's like, "No." He just visualizes all the combos instantly and he knows, wow, this is probably an over bluffed spot, so click call.

They'll say something like, "Oh, I have king queen with the bad suits. The king has a good suit, the queen has a bad suit," right? That they'll be able to say that as they're playing.

## Database Review

Wolf Dog, "Is there a good video or guide on reviewing your DB to find leaks?" Uh, yes, there should be by Ryan Riisk, um, in the mastery section, a DB analysis. Um, I think we put it under game theory. So look for that there.

## Three-Bet Range Strategy

Nimbru is asking, what's my opinion on using a linear range for three bets, big blind versus in position versus using the polar one? 

Um, both fine. Um, I actually feel like right here playing 1K, 2K. So as an answer I'd say these days everyone uses GTOs. So if you can play a non-GTO wizard sizing in a non-GTO wizard range, you already have your opponents out of their comfort zone after, out of their drilling zone. 

Um, so if I had to choose, I'd say by using the 13BB one, uh, your study is useful for offense and defense. If you have the capacity to do both, probably the 10BB one is going to overperform just based on people not knowing what to do. Uh, but yet not very important. There is no significant EV difference. Just make sure whatever you do, you play it well. The 10BB linear range for three bets is easier to play because you get to range bet all the time. 13BB you have to play polar strats, which are a bit harder.

## Four-Bet Jamming

And then what's my thought on four bet jamming hands out of position? Um, is it worth implementing? When's it a good idea to do so? 

Yeah, I would say it's probably worth implementing. Uh, what four bet jamming hands lets you do? Um, so Nimbru is asking in some solver solutions when you're 100 deep, you actually just four bet shove over a three bet. And this is often with hands like ace king.

Um, I think the main thing that this accomplishes is just, you have less ace-kings post-flop, um, and that tends to be a good thing. You don't want all your ace-kings four-betting. That's the main reason, in my eyes, to do this, uh, because when you four-bet, everyone puts you on ace-king. So imagine you actually four-bet shove all your ace-kings and you never have ace-king when you four-bet, people are going to misplay quite a lot against you. They're going to... 'Cause people, in their heads, they simplify when they play poker. So they round 80% to 100%. They round 20 to 0. So some ace-high board, they're going to say, "Oh, fuck, he has ace-king." Or some jack-high board, they're going to be like, "He has a bunch of ace-king high," whatever. They're, that's how people think about your range. So playing with the numbers, I feel like is nice. That's a fairly advanced play. Um, yeah. It's not important, but I would do it if it's not hard for you to do it.

## Exploiting Tight Passive Players

Lexley's asking, "Could we suggest unorthodox lines to exploit straightforward tight and passive live population that over-folds with..." 

So what... I'll ask a question, Lexley, and you guys can answer by just editing your reply, and that way we're in a live chat. But why do you want an unorthodox line to exploit? What's wrong with the orthodox lines? Why do you need something fancy? 

If someone is straightforward tight and passive, and you want to win money with air, just bluff, right? Like, why do you need an unorthodox bluffing line?

And you're saying if I check raise on the flop, my opponent's going to fold top pairs by the river. I assume you mean in three-bet pots? Um, and in three-bet pots, top pairs are generally supposed to stack off, so it sounds like you're saying people don't bluff catch. They just call with only value catchers, right? They only call if they think they're beating value. 

And generally if that's true, you just bluff, bluff your pants off, all the time. And you need to learn how to do that. That's not a trivial thing to do. That doesn't mean bluff with your open-enders or bluff with your gutshots. That means close your eyes and put your stack in kind of bluffing. Right? Like, you three-bet a guy with ace-king, you miss, put your stack in. You three-bet a guy with five-six suited and you miss, maybe you put your stack in, with no draw, on some high-card board. Right? That depends how extreme we're going.

But if you want... So the unorthodox line would be, check one street and then start over-betting. You could try that as well. So when you have air, check, give up, and if they check again, just blast into them, like, over-bet, over-bet, or big bet, over-bet.

## Targeting and Range Thinking

Yoni, "Targeting's an important concept versus bet and let them decide. So when I study, do you recommend that I think about what part of the villain range I'm making in different..." 

Uh, Yoni, which stakes are you currently playing? If, if that's okay to ask, just so I have a frame of reference, 'cause you sound very serious about studying. "Two-five live, 10 NL." Okay.

So two-five live is very, very, very soft. Everyone's very bad, very face-up, very extreme arch types. Kind of what you need to beat two-five live is actually... Yeah, but to move up from those stakes, you need to crush those stakes. It's an important skill set. So it's very important that you don't be focused on studying and playing GTO. Be focused on crushing your stakes. 

So the skill you're developing now is categorizing players and adjusting to those players correctly. And yeah, you need to think about your opponent's range, but for you in two-five live... And again, I'm sorry, I'm always very practical with things. So when you play two-five live, you need to think about your specific opponent's range, and not the solver range.

In GTO Wizard or in Pio Solver you have the ability to note lock. You could use a free tool like Equilab to think about ranges. Um, if you look at The Max Exploit Academy, he often works with ranges in Equilab. He doesn't show you a solver. He just shows, oh, this is the range in Equilab. He's going to call these hands and fold those hands.

And a lot of what I would do in this kind of game is when I look at the solver solution, and this is just as an example, so if you bet flop and you overbet turn, um, you look at what is your opponent supposed to call? And then you ask yourself, "Do I think this guy is going to call more or less?" And the answer in a 2/5 game is going to be everyone is going to call less against an overbet. That's going to be almost the exclusive answer, and once you get that, you need to practice overbet bluffing and start seeing what happens to your image and how people react and do you feel okay executing that? 'Cause you're being very exposed by overbluffing.

## Mental Checklist

Matt's asking, "Do I have a mental checklist of question for each hand? What's their range? How should I play?" 

Yeah, I guess, so what happens to me and... When I see a board, uh, I always say I start with, "Who is this good for and what does that mean?" So if I see A7 deuce rainbow after I raise button, I'm like, "Great board for me. My strategy's going to be this. My hand's going to fit into that there." Right in there, it's going to be like range bet. 

If I see 5672 tone, I'd be like, "Oh, bad board for me. I need to have a lot of check backs, some of them strong. I need to mix with everything." And then where does my hand fit into that? Um, and similar for the turn or the river.

## Node Locking

Nimbru saying, "I've heard people saying that node locking your strategy on the solver is a great way to learn." 

Yeah, I think that's reasonable. So what I would do is, uh, whenever you see the solver doing something very different from you, um, go to that node and node lock how you would play that node. And then you'll see the opponent's response, and then you see the issues with your strategy. Um, and the takeaways are usually, oh, actually a lot of regs in the pool play the node the same as me, so now I've learned how to exploit them.

## Squeeze vs Regular 3-Bet Pots

Bimboo is asking, "What are some major differences between normal 3-bet pots and squeeze pots?" 

Um, cool. I'll tell you something cool for this one. Um, so the main difference is the range. When you squeeze, you have a very linear range. That means we just go from the top down, so Aces, kings, queens, Jacks, 10s. Ace, king; ace, queen; ace, jack; king, queen; king, jack. And we don't have many of the... We're not going to squeeze A7 offsuit type of stuff. 

Uh, when we 3-bet, we tend to have a more polar range, so that means we have a... If you visualize a hand chart, you have the top left square of good hands and you have that but smaller, and then you have like a scatter graph of a bunch of random stuff all over the place. So when you 3-bet it often looks more like that. 

Um, and that's the main difference, so squeeze when you're the squeezer your range is a lot stronger and it's a lot more high card heavy. Um, this means you get to play more aggressively. Um, calling ranges due to this tend to be tighter. They tend to be more pocket pair heavy. 

And we actually had a rule back in the day of if you squeeze, always at least two-barrel bluff so that they call their pocket pair once and fold on the turn. Never like one-and-done bluff 'cause the calling range against a squeeze is just a bunch of pocket pairs generally. So that's just like a shortcut for live or for very soft sides. I'd say if you squeeze, then two-barrel bluff.

## Range Asymmetry Theory

I'll show you guys some theory. Do you guys want to see some theory? 

So theory would say, where is there going to be a big deviation? So I'm going to teach you a concept called range asymmetry. Okay, let's say we'll look at NL200 ranges and, um, UTG raises, big blind 3-bets and UTG calls and we're going to pick a board that's going to be ace, jack, 9.

Good board or bad board to C-bet? Big blind 3-bet versus UTG, ace, jack, 9, two-tone.

This is your C-bet frequency on this board. See this? This is a 0% C-bet frequency. This board is terrible. Terrible. If you look at EVs out of position wins 11, in position wins 15. One of the worst possible boards.

Okay, now how did I know this? So this is the concept of range asymmetry. If we look at the range, that big blind 3-bets, you guys can see the shape. Like I said, it's this top left box and then a bunch of scattered stuff. This top left box likes cards that are queen or higher. Whatever is right below this, so the jack, 10, 9 area tends to be very bad for you. 

Uh, because if we look at the UTG range we're like, "Oh, look, pocket jacks, pocket nines, ace jack suited." This is a big deal. So now we go here and we're like, "Ace, king is like a medium hand strength. Your opponent hit a ton of nuts. You don't have much of it. You need to play super defense." It's a terrible board for you.

How do you know this? You think about range asymmetries.

## Different Positions Example

Let's switch the positions up. So we go back and now we say, uh, button raises, big blind 3-bets. And now we're going to just look at the range asymmetries. 

So big blind 3-bet range. You guys see how this, uh, this square we go down to pocket 9s and we have some stuff here? So let's say nine or higher, good for big blind. Maybe aces go down to ace jack. There is not much ace 10. 

And then if we look at the button calling, we're like, "Oh, nine or higher we're going to have all of these. We're going to have the suited aces." So let's say now given what we just looked at, uh, I pick out a board and I say ace, 8, 7 'cause then you have no pairs, you have no two pairs and the other guy has all the eights, all the sevens, all the ace eights, all the ace sevens. Right? So I'm just picking based on looking at the ranges.

10% C-bet frequency if you pot. If say you go quarter pot, some guys range bet this board, guys. Quarter pot you'd get to have like a 30% frequency. And again, terrible board for you.

So this is the long answer to that question. Um, cool. Okay. Um, basically, look at ranges to see the differences.

## MTT vs Cash

"Cash player. Is there any benefit to learn some MTT player? Would it be more distracting?" 

I mean, there's not... I don't know, man. Um, tournaments are good and fun for mats. It's not all about profit, but I don't think it's going to help your cash game very much. Um, it's going to help your short stack cash game if there are short stacks at the table, but yeah. That's not the reason to do it. Just do it 'cause you want to play tournaments.

## Top Players

Sick Joker is asking who are top five players according to me. 

I mean, at this point, you kind of have to say... Uh, so we had a championship and the clear top three in my mind were Owen, Asian Flushy, and Linus, according to that. So those three would have to be in top five. And then it's hard for me to comment outside of that. 

Um, I have a strong preference for the guys I worked with, and work with, so... But I can't say who's top five, who's top 10, right? Uh, but I do think Linus, Asian Flushy, and Owen are up there. Uh, Clamma's up there. There's, uh, Dijan from GG Network, extremely good. Tobias, Barak, Petar, very strong guys. Rigged is very good. There are a bunch of great guys up there. I can't rank who are the top fives. I don't play those stakes, so... Um, but they're all very good. Uh, Kevin Pacca is amazing as well.

## Micro Stakes Discussion

Data Guild is saying, "Can I expand more on why it's not good to start at micro stakes?" 

I mean, so don't take this the wrong way, right? Um, this is just my opinion. Everyone has what suits them. Um, I feel like if you want to progress in poker, uh, I would try to skip past micro stakes by having some income, making enough money that you can start playing lower stakes, like 25 NL. 

That's the way I would do it if I had to start. I wouldn't be like, "Deposit $20, start at two NL." But I've never tried. It's probably fine. I just... If you're stuck at micro stakes, I'd... If you feel stuck, I would suggest really getting some income and moving to higher stakes where you care more about the money and seeing if that helps.

If you're progressing and doing well, just make sure you're not wasting too much time there. You don't need to prove to anyone that you can beat micro stakes. 

I had a friend who was winning at NL200. He was a guy in my CFP back in the day, and still is, and he was winning NL200 Zoom at like four, five BB per hundred. And then he told me, "I want to do this for six months and prove to myself I can keep up the win rate for half a million hands before I move up to the next stake." And then me as a coach, I just told him, "Look, dude, this is retarded. You're already good enough. Just move up and stop wasting everyone's time." Right? You don't need half a million hands.

## Balancing Accuracy vs Exploitation

Robin's saying, "Hey Uri, I've had an exploitative game plan. Now I'm playing 2K and I feel like I should focus on executing accurately. Uh, should I at some point prioritize accuracy?" 

Yeah, I think so. Uh, I think you should at some point. There comes a point where all the tricks you have, more and more of them stop working and then you just find yourself in a node where you need to make a decision and you have no exploitative reason to do anything. So you want to have a reasonable framework for that, uh, if you don't already. 

It doesn't have to be high accuracy but you need to get to reasonable accuracy if you haven't done that. And I assume if you haven't done that, you're playing 2K NL either live or on some ring fence site. 'Cause on the main sites you'd probably have had to get accurate earlier. 

Um, but yeah, just don't be a nit about accuracy. Just get reasonable at it. No one cares if you bluff 15% too much. No one's gonna know.

## Best Position to Study

"If I had to study only one position, which position would it be?" 

Um, button, small blind and big blind is the answer, 'cause you put three question marks. But those would be the highest impact positions.

## Current Stakes

Sick D Joker asks, "Which limit do I play nowadays?" 

So I played... I'll tell you what I played this year. GG Network, I play 10/20, uh, when I play, uh, for fun. It's the highest that runs, but I'm not sure I would play much higher than NL5K. 

That being said, highest I've played this year: I have played 100-200 Squid PLO more than one time, which is equivalent to like 500-1K and I almost played a similar holdem game. So basically, I play anything but I wouldn't play any lineup. I'm not top 20 in the world at this point, so I just need the game to be good. But yeah, I can hang out with the 2k-5k NL regs generally and do okay but not the top-top guys. I'm not in fighting shape enough to play with those guys without a big whale.

## C-Betting on Bad Boards

"Makes me wonder how often I'm c-betting on terrible boards." 

Yes, you are c-betting on terrible boards a lot. Look, guys, everyone is terrible at poker, right? This is why I show you guys Ace Jack nine and it's 0% c-bet and nobody knows. Nobody knows anything about poker. Everyone knows a ton and they don't know a ton. It's a very deep game. That's why we have an edge, that's why studying adds to our win rate. 

You're c-betting on terrible boards a lot and neither you nor your opponents know about it. So what you want to recognize is first of all stop c-betting on them but also then you'll catch all the guys who are c-betting on them and then punish them for that. And that's when you start, this is the idea of reciprocity, that's when you start being, "Oh, I'm playing this node better than everyone else."

## Study Hours

So Yoni's asking, "How many hours of study did high stakes players study to get there?" 

I can speak for myself, I was doing like five hours a week at some point. Um, yeah, I think a lot of guys in our group were doing, let's say an hour a day, I think is reasonable to study. 

Uh, but study tools have changed a lot since I came up in poker. So it's much easier to study nowadays than it used to be. We didn't have GTO Wizard. Pio Solver would take you a long time to run and then you'd want to switch a parameter and that would take you a long time to rerun. So studying used to be tougher than it is now.

## Online vs Live Differences

And online, you're playing NL 10? So I'd say ... Uh, I don't know, dude. I'd consider, if you don't mind the money, move up to NL 50 and see what happens. 

Uh, but one of the big things that's different between live and online is pre-flop. Online, people are a lot more accurate pre-flop, so make sure you're playing accurately pre-flop. Live will mess you up. You'll see ... You might have a bunch of bad habits that you're not aware of. 

So make sure that you get pre-flop, okay? That's a really big thing. Pre-flop, and that pre-flop includes the rake. Live players are so loose compared to what they should be.

Don't cold call, don't cold call too much. You studied pre-flop too. So, so you're appropriately tight pre-flop? And then you're breaking even ... Yeah, I think that's too loose for NL 10. Are you studying for NL 10 rake? Should probably be like 20 to 19/11, I'd guess.

## Moving Past Single Raise Pots

Dr. T is saying ... "Most guys say, oh, but I want to play nosebleed, so I have to study theory." No, study to play the, beat the game you're playing now. That's the game I want you to beat. Because when you start beating the current game, it really snowballs.

So for me, button versus big blind, uh, I would study it for a week and then move on. That's how I would do it. And I'd be very... this is my style. I study very shallow in terms of I don't try to get accurate. I'm not gonna study every board texture. I'm not gonna zone in on every frequency and every suit. I want to do a reasonable job and have no EV loss and do that across the board for all the spots. 

Um, yeah, if you've done it for a year, move on and try giving yourself max one week per spot. Go through all the spots and then come back to me and ask me after, I would say.

## Solver Usage in Live Poker

Ben's asking: how far up in stakes do you need to go in live poker before you need to start studying using solvers? 

Um, I know a guy who... I know more than... I know a guy who made it all the way up to 200, 400 online and higher live and he never used solvers, but he would talk strategy with people who use solvers. 

So you don't have to do anything, um, but you have to think about poker and... Yeah, I don't know. You don't have to use solvers if you're... Yeah, you don't have to. I think that's a simple answer. But they're going to help if you use them.

There was a guy on PokerStars, uh, King Ten of Clubs was his name. He mass multi-tabled, had the sick win rate, like, I don't know, five BB per 100 mass multi-tabling, 24 tables, 24 hours a day, and he didn't use a HUD. And at some point he added a HUD and then his win rate went up to like six and a half big blinds. So do you need a HUD? No. Is it going to help? Yes.

## Punishing C-Bets on Bad Boards

Pokermock is saying, "If people see bet on a bad board, what's the punish?" 

Um, okay, I'll show you. So these are simple questions, right? We were saying, we were giving example of a board where out of position couldn't see bet, right? So A, 7, 8 out of position, barely see bets and 3-bet pot by big blind versus button and what we can do is we can remove the check option and this is what you do in Pio Solver or in a tool that lets you node lock. 

We'd force him to see bet and then we get the answer from the solver of how do you punish him, and this is like... This to me is a useful way to do for live as well, because here you kind of force the solver to mimic a strategy that someone's using and then you see, well, what's the response if I force him to see bet? 

And we're not going to get into this too deep, but the response is, uh, it starts with raising a ton and it moves to never folding almost anything. You'll see that we call as wide as queen, ten of diamonds or raise queen, ten of diamonds. So it's a version of going bananas. We raise a shit ton of everything. We float a ton. We just are kind of, "My range is stronger than yours. Thank you for putting in money for me," right? The guy basically range bet for you. Had he checked, we would have made this bet, but he's making it for us.

## Solver Study Priorities

Kayashar, "What's the main priorities first three to four months studying with Solvers?" 

Uh, my main priority is for you to have a coherent game plan you can execute well. So I'd say, pick a size, uh, whether it's a big size or a small size. Go, "Okay, I want to learn how to play this size in position pre-flop raiser." Spend some time doing that until you can do it reasonably. Don't be a perfectionist. 

And then move on and do that so you play reasonably in all your nodes. Reasonably three bet pots out of position, reasonably three bet pots in position, reasonably four bet pots. Be very okay with being very inaccurate. Just kind of reasonable frameworks, that's where you want to be getting in the beginning and then you build on top of that after. But you need that in order to play.

## Range Definition

Yoni's asking, "Define precisely what is a range, shapes, structure, or big picture. Is it global frequency plus EV buckets?" 

Yeah, I mean, that's one way to say it. You could also just say hand type. So you could say, "I have a bunch of overpairs, some overcards, and some air." And I'm supposed to be very aggressive. That would also be a description of what this would look like.

Let's do an example. So let's say we want to overbet Ace 9 4 Rainbow, for whatever reason, BVB. Small blind checks, big blind is supposed to play overbets. Let's say, for a random reason, we're looking at this range and we want to define what it looks like. 

So this is how I think of this range. I start out looking at the value range and I'm like, "The core of this range is two pair plus. The full frequency hands, the thing this range is built around, is two pair plus." That's where I start out.

And then I'd be like, "It also has a small amount of good top pairs, and then it has a bunch of bluffs. What do the bluffs look like?" And then I start going through the bluffs, and I'd be like, "You know, ace, nine, four, we have all the gut shots. We have a bunch of backdoor draws."

And we have a few nine-x, very few. And then, um, a few four-x, but very few. And then it depends how far you want to go. 'Cause you can go... I often go, "Oh, just a few nine-x, I'm going to ignore those. Just a few four-x, I'm going to ignore those." 

So this is stabbing for an overbet, two pair plus, small amount of good top pairs, bunch of backdoor draws. I'm done, right? That's me for this. That's how I would go. That's the big picture of the range. Two pair plus, small amount of good top pairs, bunch of backdoor draws, some... Every gut shot. That's it.

## Anonymous Zone Tables

Andrew is asking, "Any advice on playing anonymous zone tables rather than regular tables?" 

Um, I don't know. I never played those too much. I think, um... Anonymous zone tables, that's Ignition, I think. And it... Yeah. 

I haven't played those. I just know they're very good tables so keep playing that site. Add WPT Gold as well. Um, and Ignition is its own skillset. In Ignition, you get to download hands at the end of the day with the revealed hole cards. So definitely do that, and maybe by digging through those, you'll be able to recognize some of the regulars in your games and their tendencies. Um, so that might be my advice there.

## Bluffing Without Getting Noticed

"How do I bluff my pants off while avoiding getting noticed? Does it even matter if the lowest stakes reg notices I'm overbluffing?" 

Um, I mean, people notice you a lot less than you think. Um, but yeah, part of what happens when everyone's nit and you want to bluff a lot is, at some point, they're going to notice that you're bluffing a lot, and they're going to get less nitty. And you want to notice that. But that's a good learning experience for you to have. 

Um, if you wanted to be very camouflaged about it, you could make sure not to over... Not to bluff your pants off, but to bluff, say, half of your pants off, and then it's less noticeable, right? So there are ways to do it, um, especially in a live game. Like, after you get called bluffing, be like, "Fuck, the one time in a million years I run a bluff. This is just because my girlfriend tilted me," and just make up a story. I don't know.

But when you're aggressive, people notice at some point. There's no way around that, and then you start playing a different game, and it's a fun game. You get paid off more.

## High Stakes Without Much Study

Marcus is saying, "Hey." Um, uh, okay, "Exploits? I also think... How did you think about..." 

Um, so first of all, thank you. But, um, I never played super high volume, but I just had fun all the time. Um, and I... Yeah, there's a price you pay for being very focused. You get in less volume, and this is one of the things, uh, actually Owen Prodigy told me recently, is that he likes to have a theoretical game plan he can fall back on. And so he can kind of lazily play theory and then when a spot comes up that he wants to exploit, he does it. 

Whereas if you're less... If you're trying to exploit every single spot, it's just a bit exhausting. And then by the time you get an actual good spot, you might be too tired or tilted to get it. So you want to be striking a balance. You just see me making videos. So, um, sometimes when I play, I just do something because it's fine to do it and I don't think too much.

Uh, but yeah, taking notes, I think, is just part of the game. You just want to be taking notes. You can review the notes beforehand. Stuff gets automated.

## How Good Players Actually Are

Maclag is asking, "What's the main difference between very good players and crushers? I feel like it gets to the point where everyone's just as studied as the next..." 

No, it never gets to that point. Dude, you guys have no idea. I'll... Okay, so I'll tell you guys another story. Uh, I started studying with Pio Solver, say 2013, roughly speaking, and I had a bunch of frameworks for how to do stuff and a bunch of exploits for mid-stakes. And I was playing 1KNL, 2KNL, uh, and I was very intimidated by 5KNL because I was sure everyone there knew all the stuff I was doing. 

Um, and, like, fast-forward 12 years later, GTO Wizard is out, whatever. Half the guys at high-stakes don't know the stuff I was doing 12 years ago. So no, there's... Not everyone is just as studied as the next guys. They're actually... You can count on one or two hands the guys who play most nodes in the game tree reasonably. 

Uh, poker is a very, very hard game. Um, everyone C-bets correctly. That's as far as it gets to being studied enough for high-stakes regs. People are not barreling turn well, they're not playing well versus check backs, they're not, uh... People even make pre-flop mistakes in high-stakes heads-up. 

Uh, there was a time where Limitless was open sitting all the nosebleed lobbies heads-up and he was over-folding to three bets by, like, 10% heads-up over a very, very big sample. Or an under three-betting. Like, just his basic stats were off. So just so you guys know, this is a sport. We're very far from perfect at high-stakes. That's very important to keep in mind. As you... This is why I tell people, "Don't start at micro-stakes." People are bad at poker everywhere.

## Bomb Pots

Nimbru is asking how to study bomb pots effectively. That's a good one! I would say filter your database for bomb pots and click through them would be a good start. You can use tools like RocketSolver, which is a $70 tool, to look at the solver solution and think about are people going to overfold/underfold, overbluff/underbluff... Think about that a bit. There is a course by Jayzer on bomb pots which might be worth taking a look at; I haven't seen it but Jayzer used to be one of the top regs so it's probably reasonable.

## Non-Solver Study Methods

Spicy is asking how do people who don't use solvers typically study? They just think about hands and talk to their friends about hands so they'll post hand histories here and ask people what would you do there for example as a good way to study. And then just get feedback from good players.

## Breaking Even at Low Stakes

So Yoni - last time we talked about Yoni not beating 10NL... I had a student who was breaking even at NL200 Zoom and breaking even at NL500 Zoom and he was very strong theoretically; he'd studied a lot. What we did with him is he started playing on Ignition, an American site where you get hand histories. He saw his opponents' hands; he started realizing how bad everyone was and how much he could deviate from theory... And then he went back and crushed all the stakes he was breaking even at before. 

So there is a decent chance if you're breaking even at NL10 that you're too stuck to GTO and that when people give stuff away like do some weak bet sizing and you should bluff raise, you're not doing it. So I'd try to examine that as a reason.

## Final Thoughts

JuiceSkillz last question: thanks for the effort; it's hard to combine the knowledge in a way that will be useful at the table. I think you just have to practice playing; if you're not sure market then think about it later and next time it'll get easier... Just kind of go over and over.

Fishbet: the content in The Lab can take you very high if you're talented enough. Like I said a lot of the coaches here have made it all the way up so when you look at live plays from me or Tim Jenkins or PlayItSmart or any of the other guys, you're really looking at live plays from world-class players. So if you can take all the information out of there, I wouldn't say there's a very high limit for how high you can go but at some point you're going to have to do work on yourself as this isn't like coaching nosebleed reg levels.

Okay cool guys - so thanks everyone! I'll upload this to the site; if you guys have an opinion about how to do it next time let me know! Cool okay bye guys
