# Postflop Profit Distribution Principle

## The Connection to Preflop

"Okay guys. So, similar to this principle that we're seeing preflop of the best hands making the most money, we have the same principle postflop and they are very closely connected."

## The Example: Strong vs Weak Hands

"Imagine that we would have a board like Ace Seven Deuce, and there's say fifty dollars on the pot."

### Strong Hands Overperform

"If you have something like a set, you expect to make more than fifty dollars."

### Weak Hands Underperform

"On the other hand, if you have something like King Eight on Ace Seven Deuce, even though you might actually have the best hand twenty-five percent of the time, you might have thirty percent equity against your opponent's range. You don't expect to actually win thirty percent of the pot share."

## The Core Principle

"And these two things go hand in hand. The really strong hands make extra money at the expense of the weak and medium strength hands. This is a principle of poker."

## Why Weak and Medium Hands Struggle

"Weak and medium strength hands underperform because they can only make bad decisions, it's very tough to maneuver with them. You're constantly faced with bets that are too big or you have to check and let your opponent catch up. It's very tough to play these hands well unless you can see your opponent's cards."

## Why Strong Hands Excel

"Whereas with very strong hands, if your opponent's bluffing you make money. If he's calling you make money. If he's folding you folded out his equity. So in a way you make money. So these hands are like a win-win-win all over the place."

## The General Principle

"So this is a very general principle of how poker works."

## Looking Forward

"And next we're going to dive into some specific hand examples to show you guys the difference between some of these hand classes."
