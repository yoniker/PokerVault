# Suited Connectors

## The Magic and the Cost

"Let's start with suited connectors. Suited connectors are a very magical type of hand in that when they hit it's very disguised. It's a very strong hand or a very strong draw and it's extra fun cracking your opponent's Aces with some junkie Five Eight suited that he could never see coming."

"However, you always need to pay a price to see the flop, the turn and the river, but mostly right now we're talking about preflop and some of these hands hit more often than others. So even though when they hit magic things tend to happen."

## The Exercise: How Often Each Hand Hits

"I want to take you guys through a quick exercise of how often each hand type is going to hit."

### Five Six Suited (Connected)

"So imagine Five Six suited. This hand has three different ways to make an open-ended straight draw. If it comes Three Four, Four Seven, or Seven Eight."

### Five Seven Suited (One-Gapper)

"Five Seven suited only has two ways, Four Six and Six Eight."

### Three Four Suited (Connected)

"Three Four suited, two ways, Two Five and Five Six."

### Five Eight Suited (Two-Gapper)

"And Five Eight suited, a three-gapper, only has one way to make an open-ended straight draw. If the board comes with a Six and a Seven."

## The Investment Comparison

"So what we see here is that even though all of these hands are speculative investments, Five Six suited is one and a half times as good of an investment as Five Seven or Three Four. And these are twice as good of an investment as Five Eight suited."

## Practical Playing Guidelines

"So while all these hands might feel similar, they are actually worlds apart."

"And whereas a hand like Five Six suited is very often playable, Five Seven, Three Four and Five Eight are mostly played when they're closing the action and you're in the big blind. They rarely get to open. They don't really flat opens. They don't really flat three bets."

"They're significantly worse investments, and you would need a really good reason to play them unless you just feel like gambling and don't mind losing a small amount of money."
