# The Importance of High Cards

## The Question

"What about how high your cards are?"

## King Queen vs King Nine

"So there is a fairly big difference between a hand like King, Queen and King Nine."

### Reason 1: Domination

"One of the reasons for that is domination. So when you hit the King, a Queen kicker is significantly better than a Nine kicker. And the distribution of money, like I said, goes way more to the top hand, so you actually end up winning quite a bit more money."

### Reason 2: Second Card Strength

"But the second reason is the second card, the Queen, is going to be top pair more often than the Nine is going to be top pair when it hits, right?"

"When you hit a pair of Nines, there are more cards that could be above it, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. Whereas when you hit a pair of Queens, it's only the King and the Ace, and you're even holding the King so very likely to be top pair."

## The Money Distribution Principle

"And like I said, in poker, top pairs are making more than their fair share, whereas middle pairs tend to make less than their fair share of the money. So this is a lot more important than it looks like."

## Two Pair Considerations

"And this goes forwards to a hand like two pair, where King Queen, when it makes two pair, it's more likely to be top two than a hand like King Nine or King Seven, which might be top and bottom."

## High Cards vs Low Cards

"And these kinds of things are what make high cards significantly stronger than low cards. Even though in poker everything can hit, the distribution of boards and hands that you're going to get when you have two high cards is basically more top pairs, more top two pairs."

"And when you have two low cards, say something like Ten Seven offsuit, the pairs you hit are often going to be middle or bottom pairs. And when you make two pairs is unlikely to be top two."

## The Investment Perspective

"So generally speaking, your investment in your draw, your preflop draw, because every hand in poker is essentially a preflop draw, is just to weaker hands."

## The Bottom Line

"And these differences add up and they're very big, especially when you consider how marginal even a hand like King Queen might be in the first place."
