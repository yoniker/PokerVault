# Why Play Marginal Hands

## The Question

"I was asked the question, if a few hands make the majority of the money, why play the rest?"

## Core Reasons to Play Marginal Hands

### Direct Profitability

"And very, very straightforward answer. First of all, the rest of the hands do make money, so why not play them? And poker is a game of small, incremental edges."

"The reason is because these hands make money. We play them because they make money."

### Balance and Deception

"But second reason is that if you only play the very best hands, people in poker pay attention to what you're doing, whether it's online or in a live setting. People are going to recognize you're in it. Then your good hands are going to make less money."

"So, the reason that we play the rest of the hands isn't so that our good hands can make money. The reason is because these hands make money. We play them because they make money."

### The Effect on Premium Hands

"A side effect of playing them is your range of hands becomes looser, and so your strongest hands actually start making more money, which means if I only ever play Aces, I'm not going to get action from anyone ever."

"But if I start playing Aces and Kings and Queens and Ace King, I'm still not going to get action from anyone ever. But when you start widening this, more and more people do start giving you action. And so your good hands start, say, winning more than the blinds."

## Practical Application

### Flexibility in Playing These Hands

"You don't have to play them. You can fold them in certain table conditions. Don't get married to them. If you really have to go to the bathroom and it's a live game, fold a hand, right? Recognize how important or not important they are."

"So yeah, these hands are important to play. It's just despite these hands being correct to play, they're the sort of hands that you can mix around with. Don't feel like you have to play them."

### When to Tighten Up

"If you're tired, if you're tilted, if you got a read from someone, if it's the best player in the world sitting to your left, feel free to play much tighter than the game theory ranges."

### When to Loosen Up

"And vice versa. If all the people behind you are terrible and you have reads on them, you can play looser."

## Key Takeaways

"These ranges are just a guideline and it's fine to deviate from them."
