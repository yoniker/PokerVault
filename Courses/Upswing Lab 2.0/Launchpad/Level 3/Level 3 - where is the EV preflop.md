# Preflop Opening Charts and Profit Distribution

## The Shocking Discovery

"Hey guys. Crazy thing. I would never have guessed this before looking at the computer. This is an opening chart for under the gun, six handed. And when you click on each hand, it shows you how much money the hand is making."

## Hand Profitability (Under the Gun, 6-Handed)

"So Aces makes 9.3BB. Kings makes 5.4BB This is in blinds, so multiply it by whatever stakes you make. Queens makes 2BB. And something like Q9s makes 0.01BB. Something like KQo makes 0.06BB"

"So the drop ups are very, very sharp. And this is actually a very common thing in poker."

## The 73% and 93% Rule

"The crazy thing you'd get is if you add up all of the numbers here for all the hands,AA,KK,QQ together are making 73% of the money of all of these hands."

"And if you go JJ,QQ,KK,AA,AK,AQ right? So just like the top 3-4% percent of hands, those are actually making 93% of the money. Everything else in the opening range is just filler."

## The Perception vs Reality Gap

"And I think that that's fascinating to know because we have, or at least I always had a different perception of these hands. Because poker, when you're just starting out, it's fun just to get dealt a playable hand, right? King Queen offsuit is a playable hand. Nine Eight suited is a playable hand. Pocket Deuces is a playable hand. And you spend so much of your time folding, when it's your turn to play you kind of want to play."

"But poker isn't really a game that works exactly like that, and the rewards are not distributed evenly."

## Poker as Investing

"So I like to think of poker kind of like investing. So we invest money into our hand at a certain decision point in order to see more cards or to continue with a hand, or we say we're passing. And I feel like it's very important to kind of know this is a baseline and work from there."

"And preflop is one of the most basic and most important decision points to get right. After you've studied a bit this will come very, very automatically to you."

## Chart Study Approach

"And Upswing Poker has charts that show you how to play preflop. So, before you look at those charts, which you have to look at those charts, there's no way around it, what I want to add is the memorization and accuracy don't tend to be very important, at least at first and not even that much later because of this differing reward payout."

## The Flexibility in Marginal Hands

"So when you see this chart you might be like, 'wow, Nine Seven suited is a fold, I would've opened that from this position.' Oh, minus zero point zero one, that's actually fairly negligible. Nine Seven suited, Eight Six suited, even Ace Nine offsuit. These hands would not really lose you any significant amount of money opening."

"So while you do want to have the charts as a frame of reference, I want you guys, as you're studying them, not to be hard on yourself to remember the exact edges. Of course you can memorize these by knowing the edges, but also to kind of know that you're free to play around with these."

## Adjusting to Table Dynamics

"If you have a read that someone is folding, they're busy on their phone, or there's some weaker player at the table, definitely feel free to go looser."

"And if there's some aggro maniac who's attacking you all the time, or even just a really great player who's much better than you are at this stage, so I'm sure you will improve to beat him someday guys, then don't worry about not opening Queen Nine suited. It's barely worth any money. The presence of someone who's outlaying you is going to outweigh this."

## Looking Forward

"So that would be my intro to studying preflop. In the next videos, I want to explain a bit about the dynamics of why these differences are actually so big so you understand the reason and not just memorization here."
