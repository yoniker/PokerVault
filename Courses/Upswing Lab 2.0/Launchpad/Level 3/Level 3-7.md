# Preflop Sizing Guide

## Introduction

"Hey guys, what's up? This video is going to be about sizings preflop. So we're going to talk about opening sizings, three bet sizings, four bet sizings, in position, out of position..."

"And this is a very big game tree, because like I said, you are going to have a different sizing in position and out of position. You're going to have a different sizing at different stack depth. Sometimes you're squeezing people and sometimes there is an ante involved. So there are a lot of different things that go into this."

"And what I want to give you guys in this video is just kind of the barebone simplified framework so that you guys are doing it sort of okay without having to do too much work. And as you dive deeper into poker, you can work on getting things more analytical if you choose to. But generally speaking in poker, if you get it close to correct, that tends to be good enough."

## Raise First In (RFI) Sizing

### The Theory

"So we'll start with RFI sizing, raise first in. Imagine had we limped, big blind would get a free look with any two cards. When we min-raise, he gets to continue fairly wide and there's this threshold of raising a bit more than min-raising because so many of the big blind's hands are junkie that makes him actually have to start to fold quite a lot."

"And that's why usually raises tend to be somewhere between 2.2x to 2.5x. This is very technical."

### The Recommendation

"So if I had to recommend raise size, I'll just say go two and a half x the blind. So if it's five-ten, go to twenty-five. If it's one-two, go to five."

"It's not a disaster if you vary this a bit. So if you're in live poker and it's more comfortable to go 3x or more comfortable to go 2x with chips, but I like in a one-two raise to five, that's a five dollar chip. So, this would be the raise first in size."

### With Antes

"With antes involved, generally speaking, this gets bigger. Games with antes, the big blind is getting a better price, so we want to raise a bit bigger to get the same effect. And this is going to depend on the size of the ante, but just kind of keep it in mind in case you do play those games. I know they are less common."

## Three Betting

### The Concept

"The idea with three betting is kind of similar. So, when you raise and I three bet, there are hands in your range that are going to be easy folds and there are hands that are going to be easy calls and are not very sizing sensitive."

"But there's a group of hands which is sizing sensitive and those are, while everything's a bit sizing sensitive, but let's say the medium strength hands are the ones we want to give a tough time."

### Example of Poor Sizing

"So, to give a simple example against, say someone raised to five dollars from under the gun, I three bet him to ten dollars in position, he would basically not have to fold anything and he'd be happy to continue with any pair, any suited card, even offsuit hands that he opened. And so this three bet size is inefficient, it's too small."

### Three Betting In Position

"And generally speaking, we want to go something like 3x when we're in position. This is going to give people a tough time with pocket pairs and suited connectors and suited aces and suited broadways, and offsuit broadways, all of those marginal hand groups where you want to give them pot odds that are not quite easily good enough."

"And this is going to vary by stack size because imagine someone is thirty blinds deep, you can actually put the same amount of pressure on his pocket sixes or in his Ace Four suited by going for a smaller size because he's playing for less behind. So the pot odds don't help him as much."

"So there will be this theoretical variability where as you get shorter, we go smaller. And as you get deeper we go a bit bigger. But generally speaking, 3x in position is a fairly good catchall size. It's fine a hundred deep, it's fine fifty deep, it's fine a hundred and fifty deep."

"Ideally you'd go 4x a hundred and fifty deep and maybe two and a half x fifty but I think just starting out with 3x and not worrying about it too much is a good start. That's for three bets in position."

### Three Betting Out of Position

"Three bets out of position, similar reason. I'd say just go 4x. The ideas again to give people a tough time so they don't instantly call all their pairs and suited hands and decent offsuit hands."

"And so when I say this, you can imagine if someone goes smaller than 3x in position or smaller than 4x out of position, you should be calling those three bets quite a lot. Whereas if they start going larger, you can get more and more comfortable with the idea of folding hands as good as pocket Threes or Five Six suited or Ace Nine suited, et cetera."

"But yeah, out of position, similar idea. As we get deeper, we would size this up; as we get shorter, we'd size this down. But 4x is a good default starting size that will serve you well for most situations."

## Four Betting

### The Complexity

"Now about four bets, four bets are a bit more complicated. Well, I'll say there are a few more moving pieces."

"The big moving piece with four bets is that there is a threshold of how much money you put in where you're basically all-in. So let's say I'm a hundred deep, I raise to two and a half, you three bet me to ten. If I were to four bet to forty, I can't fold when you shove. So there is a limit to the size I can go."

### The Sizing Logic

"Similarly when we four bet, because there's less money behind, sizes get smaller. So this is, like I said, when we're very short, you can three bet smaller. When we're in the four bet situation, there's less money behind, so for the same reason we can four bet smaller and still give our opponent a tough time."

### Four Bet Recommendations

"So four bets, I would say, first of all, you should consider maybe just shove. And this is especially true as you get shorter, like forty big blinds deep, thirty big blinds deep, fifty big blinds deep."

"If you don't shove, good default would be something like two to 2.2x in position, two point five to 3x out of position. So if we're simplifying I'd say, two and a half x in position, two and a half x out of position. And that's kind of... You're good, that should work for most stack sizes."

"And again, as you get deep, we want to size both of these up to more like the three bets, so 3x in position, 4x out position, because there's more money to play for."

## Conclusion

"And yeah, that's the preflop sizing crash course. Hope you found it useful. See you guys on the next one."
