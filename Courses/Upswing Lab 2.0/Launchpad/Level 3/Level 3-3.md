# Suited Connectors

## The Magic and the Cost

"Let's start with suited connectors. Suited connectors are a very magical type of hand in that when they hit it's very disguised. It can be a very strong hand or a very strong draw and it's extra fun cracking your opponent's Aces with some junkie 85s that he could never see coming."

"However, you always need to pay a price to see the flop, the turn and the river, but mostly right now we're talking about preflop and some of these hands hit more often than others. So even though when they hit magic things tend to happen."

## The Exercise: How Often Each Hand Hits

"I want to take you guys through a quick exercise of how often each hand type is going to hit."

### 65s (connected)

"So imagine 65s. This hand has three different ways to make an open-ended straight draw. If it comes 43, 74, or 87."

### 75s (One-Gapper)

"75s only has two ways, 64 and 86."

### 43s (Connected)

"43s, two ways, 52 and 65."

### 85s (Two-Gapper)

"And 85s, a three-gapper, only has one way to make an open-ended straight draw. If the board comes with a 76"

## The Investment Comparison

"So what we see here is that even though all of these hands are speculative investments, 65s is one and a half times as good of an investment as 75s or 43s. And these are twice as good of an investment as 85s"

## Practical Playing Guidelines

"So while all these hands might feel similar, they are actually worlds apart."

"And whereas a hand like 65s is very often playable, 75s, 43s and 85s are mostly played when they're closing the action and you're in the big blind. They rarely get to open. They don't really flat opens. They don't really flat three bets."

"They're significantly worse investments, and you would need a really good reason to play them unless you just feel like gambling and don't mind losing a small amount of money."
