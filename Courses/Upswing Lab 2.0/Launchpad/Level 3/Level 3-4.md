# Suited vs Offsuit Hands

## The Fundamental Question

"What about offsuit hands versus suited hands? Why is the difference so big?"

## Remember the Core Principle

"First thing that you have to remember is what we discussed in the beginning of this chapter, and that's that most of the money is generated by your Aces and your Kings and your Queens and everything else is kind of marginal."

## Being Suited as the Tiebreaker

"So once you realize all of these hands are very marginal as is, being suited is often the tiebreaker because when you're suited, you can make flush draws and you can make pair plus flush draws and you can make combo draws. Whereas when you're offsuit, you can't."

## The Concrete Example

"So Six Seven offsuit can make the same amount of open-enders as Six Seven suited, but it can never make an open-ended straight flush draw. And that's a big upgrade for Six Seven to be suited vs offsuit"

"Of course, 76o could never make a flush draw, which is also a big upgrade to 76s"

## The Bottom Line

"So again, just a completely different league of hand to be offsuit, especially with these kind of speculative drawing hands. Being offsuit is a very, very big no-no."
