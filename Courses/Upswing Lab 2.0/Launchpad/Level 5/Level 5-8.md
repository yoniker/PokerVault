My Summary:
1. When I study GTO, don't drill-drill-drill, but after each drill go through the ranges and see that I understand the structure,review the strategy and see if any hands surprise me in their actions
2. Focus on the big picture/structure and not "why TT bet more with this combo and less with that combo", subtle questions like that i should save for some other time, just focus on the structure.
# Using Solvers to Analyze Poker Hands - Study Guide

## Core Concepts

### Program Introduction and Study Philosophy

"Basically what we're going to do is we're going to start out by analyzing a hand. This is Lucid GTO. It's a very friendly program. There's ultra-high-level proficiency involved in using it."

"You guys can use this kind of program very, very easily to practice poker and start getting used to ranges and to kind of ask yourselves questions about how the game works."

"The process should be, you look at the solution, you find something that seems weird to you... And then what I would recommend, this is why we have the discord group, basically ask the question. So take a screenshot, post it and say 'I want to understand this.'"

### Building Intuition Through Analysis

"What I would recommend you guys do is kind of go through this and ask, does this make sense to you? Start out by exploring it hand by hand."

"As you're doing this, the main question I would pose to you guys is, does anything here surprise you? Always ask yourself, 'does anything here surprise me?'"

"I highly want this to be logic-based for you guys."

### Understanding Board Texture and Continuations

"We're kind of building our intuition. If we have Ace King, we call, that makes sense, right? If we have Ace Queen, we call. If we have Ace Jack, we need the club to continue."

"Backdoor flush draws are extremely important in no limit hold'em because basically on a quarter of the deck you're improving to a flush draw, which is a very big hand in hold'em."

"So, basically against a small bet when you have decent outs to improve to a top pair or a backdoor draw, kind of good enough, right? When you don't have decent outs to improve, so say Nine Seven of spades(on Td4c3c), not good enough. Pocket pairs are good enough, even though they're mostly going to not be ahead, you just get very good pot odds because it's a small bet."

### The Importance of Study Process Over Memorization

"It's very, very tempting first time you get this program to just drill, drill, drill and see how you're doing. Now, I'm not going to do that because I know how to play these spots. But I will say I don't think that's the best way of studying."

"Really what the process I would recommend, and the one that works for me, is to be like, drill and then look and see, do I understand what's going on? Another hand and then look and see, do I understand what's going on? And build up this conceptual framework so that you know what to do more and more."

"Definitely no, don't go to the memorization route."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: Button vs Big Blind Three-Bet Pot - AcJh

- **Preflop:** Button opens, Big Blind three-bets, Button calls
- **Flop (Td4c3c):** "The board is Ten Four Three, two-tone, and our opponent bets seven point four into twenty-two point five, so roughly a third-pot bet. What do we do with Ace of clubs, Jack of hearts?"

"So let's say that we do pick that and we say, 'well,it's RNG where high means aggressive, it's a high number, let's actually raise.' So we click raise and here we kind of get to see the answer. Our action is raise, accuracy is a hundred percent and we get to see that the decision here is zero percent fold, fifty percent call, fifty percent raise."

- **Turn (5s):** "Turn is a Five. Villain checks to us after we bet. What do we want to do this hand?... We turn a gutshot, Five completes some of our hands, let's keep betting. Let's go sixty-nine percent. Bet. And we see that always bet."
    
- **Result:** "Our opponent folds."
    

### Hand 2: Big Blind Three-Bettor Strategy on Td4c3c

"What does the three bettor do on Ten Four Three, two-tone after three betting. This is a spot where you might have all sorts of questions just from your experience. I three bet Ace King and I miss, what do I do? I three bet Eight Nine suited and I get nothing. What do I do?"

"What you guys see here is check twenty-seven percent of the time, bet small half the time, bet bigger twenty percent of the time."

"What I would do on a board like this to simplify is I would bet something between one third and two thirds. Let's say one third with every single hand in my range except hands which are two spades, two hearts, or a spade and a heart."

### Hand 3: Big Blind vs Button Three-Bet Pot - 6d7d on Kd6c4c

- **Flop (Kd6c4c):** "Big blind check to us and we have Six Seven of diamonds."

"I know that when you have a hand like this, like a middle pair and your opponent checks to you, the hand can actually bet or check and it can bet any size that leads it to what we call an appropriate pot size for the hand."

"What are the benefits of checking? Well, it's not a very strong hand. Let's see a turn, maybe we improve. Also, keep our opponent's range wide... Now, the counter to that would be, if you can bet and make him fold two overcards, that's pretty great for you, so a small bet is kind of effective at doing this."

- **Turn (Ah):** "Now, the Ace is kind of an interesting card. After we bet and got called, the Ace, of course, makes our hand much, much worse. We're very rarely winning at this point."

"Does it make sense to bluff this hand and try to get my opponent to fold like Queens, Jacks, Tens, Nines types of hands? Or is this just shrug and showdown? My answer would be, I'm not sure. I feel like shrug and showdown is definitely okay."

- **River (4d):** "Four. Check to us and of course now we always check because we are sometimes winning against Four Five (no we are not, it's trips - Yonatan) or chopping against Six Seven, so no reason to bet."
    
- **Result:** "Our opponent had Nines, so we should have bluffed. Bluffing would've worked."
    

## Key Takeaways

### Strategic Simplification

"Almost without exception, what people do is they simplify to one bet size on the flop, so they would pick either the big one or the small one."

"Rather than do this complicated GTO strategy, what we take away is we get to be a lot. It's between one thirds and two thirds."

### Understanding Suits and Blockers

"When we bet on Ten Four Three, our opponent is mainly continuing with two diamonds or with a club with all of his hands that missed the board. That means he's mostly folding hands with spades and hearts. So when we hold two spades or two hearts, or a spade and a heart, those hands are not doing that great."

### Playing Top Pair in Three-Bet Pots

"We check a lot of Kx on the flop - Really? We play that defensively once he checks to us? And the answer in theory is kind of, 'well, it's a King high board and a three bet pot. You're not supposed to put in tons of money unless you have a set or two pair.' Sets and two pairs do a lot of betting, but just a top pair... Just play more defensive."

### Focus on Structure Over Details

"Focus on the big picture, on the structure, because you're going to get a different board and a different bet size and a different stack size in practice. And these things are very sensitive, so we really want to be like, 'oh, King high board, my opponent checked'. I actually play kind of defensive."

### Building Logic-Based Understanding

"The sum of those two things makes this callable. And once you see that one, or two, or three times, you kind of get used to it and it's a new baseline for you."

"How come you can call with just a gutshot? You're not going to hit it often enough. Well, the answer is, A, that when you hit it, there is a very high chance you win a big pot, it's a gutshot to the nuts. And number two, enough of the time it goes check check on the turn."
