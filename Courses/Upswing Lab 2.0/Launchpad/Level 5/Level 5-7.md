# Using Solvers to Analyze Hands

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Solver Analysis

"I want to show you a few examples of how to use solvers to analyze hands. Basically what we're going to do is we're going to start out by analyzing a hand."

"This is Lucid GTO. It's a very friendly program. There's ultra-high-level proficiency involved in using it. This is the main screen when you load up Lucid."

### Setting Up Practice Sessions

"So, you can say, I'm just playing a cash game low rake. Let's start out by playing a custom drill."

"You guys can use this kind of program very, very easily to practice poker and start getting used to ranges and to kind of ask yourselves questions about how the game works."

"Let's say we play a custom drill. We have to pick our stack size. Let's say we are two hundred deep and we want to look at preflop or postflop. Let's say postflop."

"Here we have single raised pot, three bet pot, four bet pot, or five bet pot. So, three bet pot. Say we're on the button. Villain three bets us from the big blind and we're going to play the decision until the hand ends and start the drill."

"I want to show you guys how I would use this program to study basically how to make sense of the outputs here."

## Hand Example 1: Three-Bet Pot

### The Setup

"So we start out. Remember, we call the three bet button versus big blind. The board is Ten Four Three, two-tone, and our opponent bets seven point four into twenty-two point five, so roughly a third-pot bet."

- **Flop (T♦4♣3♣):** "The board is Ten Four Three, two-tone"
- **Action:** "our opponent bets seven point four into twenty-two point five, so roughly a third-pot bet"

### Decision with Ace-Jack

"What do we do with Ace of clubs, Jack of hearts? This program has a few different aspects. First of all, your drilling options. So, fold, call or raise to twenty-four."

"Second, you have a randomizer. This says 'higher more aggressive action'. It's a number between one and a hundred. And especially as you're learning, I wouldn't worry too much about the randomizer, but let's say that if the action is close, let's say you look at this and you're like, 'you know what? Mostly call but sometimes raise', then the fact that this number is high might make you lean more towards raising."

"So let's say that we do pick that and we say, 'well it's a high number, let's actually raise.' So we click raise and here we kind of get to see the answer. Our action is raise, accuracy is a hundred percent and we get to see that the decision here is zero percent fold, fifty percent call, fifty percent raise. That was how the decision was structured."

### Turn Play

- **Turn (5♠):** "Turn is a Five. Villain checks to us after we raised."

"What do we want to do this hand? Here you see we have three different sizes. This is how aggressive we are. I'd say... We turn a gutshot, Five completes some of our hands, let's keep betting. Let's go sixty-nine percent. Bet. And we see that always bet. Our opponent folds."

### Reviewing and Learning

"Now we have the option of review hand. This is the nice thing here. Basically, this lets you kind of go backwards and forwards in the hand."

"So, say we go back to the flop, our opponent bet, and here we get to see basically how would you respond with any hand to the c-bet. What I would recommend you guys do is kind of go through this and ask, does this make sense to you? Start out by exploring it hand by hand."

### Understanding Continuation Patterns

"If we have Ace King, we call, that makes sense, right? If we have Ace Queen, we call. If we have Ace Jack, we need the club to continue. So we're kind of building our intuition."

"If we have King Queen, we need the club. If we have King Jack, we need the club. If we have Queen Jack, we mostly need the club. So this would be the overcard hands."

"You guys can see every single pocket pair continues, every single board pair continues, every single gutshot. Ace Deuce, Ace Five. With these Ace Six, Ace Seven, Ace Nine, Ace Eight, Ace Nine, we continue with a flush draw or a backdoor flush draw."

"Backdoor flush draws are extremely important in no limit hold'em because basically on a quarter of the deck you're improving to a flush draw, which is a very big hand in hold'em. And yeah, that's roughly where it ends."

### Training Intuition

"So we kind of finish our analysis and we see how does each hand play. And as you're doing this, the main question I would pose to you guys is, does anything here surprise you? Always ask yourself, 'does anything here surprise me?'"

"For me, I've looked at a million of these so everything makes sense. But maybe looking at Ace Seven of diamonds, you guys would be, 'hmm, I wouldn't have thought to continue that.' Or maybe you look at Ace Jack with a club and you say, 'oh, I missed, I would've folded.'"

"So what we're doing is we're training our intuition. I highly want this to be logic-based for you guys."

### Process for Learning

"The process should be, you look at the solution, you find something that seems weird to you, so let's say Jack Eight of diamonds continuing or, why is Fours only calling?, sometimes calling, sometimes raising and not always raising?"

"You could come up with various questions here depending on how experienced you are. And then what I would recommend, this is why we have the discord group, basically ask the question. So take a screenshot, post it and say 'I want to understand this.' And there are a lot of videos that we're going to have explaining all sorts of concepts."

### Understanding Small Bet Defense

"So I will quickly go through the structure here for you guys, so you guys understand this one and we can do a few more."

"But the order in which we studied modern poker is kind of we start out with the base framework that we get from this program, we make sense of it because we want it to make sense, we want to be able to easily recreate it, so we would say 'a small bet, we need to continue very wide, anything that has nice potential to improve, so any good overcards.'"

"Why can't we just continue King,Queen and Ace Jack? Well, they're dominated a lot because your opponent re-raised, so he's betting Ace King and you're continuing King Queen. That's not the best for you. There is a limit."

"But even here you see King Queen with no backdoor is sometimes continuing, Ace Jack with no backdoor is sometimes continuing. So you would be like, 'oh, those hands are actually kind of close.'"

"So, basically against a small bet when you have decent outs to improve to a top pair or a backdoor draw, kind of good enough, right? When you don't have decent outs to improve, so say Nine Seven of spades, not good enough. Pocket pairs are good enough, even though they're mostly going to not be ahead, you just get very good pot odds because it's a small bet. And yeah, we'd kind of finish here."

### Analyzing Opponent's Response to Raises

"Then, we could also look at the turn where, we raised, how should our opponent react to the raise? And here you see all of the hands he bets, how should he react? What should he do with Ace King?"

"If he has a club, mostly call, but sometimes re-raises a bluff. That's very interesting. Why would you re-raise Ace King with a club as a bluff? That's an interesting and fairly advanced question to ask. I wouldn't recommend at this stage you guys necessarily ask that one."

"But this kind of shows you, oh, against the raise I still call Nines and Eights once, but it's starting to get a bit dicey. I can call some Ace Kings, fold some depending on the backdoor draw."

### Understanding Gutshot Play

"And we're starting to see how important having even a single club is on a board with two clubs and you're like, 'oh, a gutshot. I can just call with Six Seven to a raise, even though it's just a gutshot'. That's weird. How come I can just call with..? This hand doesn't seem like it has enough. I'll kind of answer that."

"How come you can call with just a gutshot? You're not going to hit it often enough. Well, the answer is, A, that when you hit it, there is a very high chance you win a big pot, it's a gutshot to the nuts. And number two, enough of the time it goes check check on the turn."

"Your opponent could have been bluff-raising the flop like I was here and then give up. If he does, you're going to have a profitable bluffing river opportunity. The sum of those two things makes this callable."

"And once you see that one, or two, or three times, you kind of get used to it and it's a new baseline for you. So, this is one drill. Hope you guys found that useful and we will do a few more."

## Three-Bettor's Strategy

### Navigating to Different Perspectives

"Back to the same simulation we drilled, what do we do facing in a three bet pot? And the nice thing in this program is you can kind of navigate to what does the three bettor do on Ten Four Three, two-tone after three betting."

"This is a spot where you might have all sorts of questions just from your experience. I three bet Ace King and I miss, what do I do? I three bet, Eight Nine suited and I get nothing. What do I do?"

### Understanding Complex Strategies

"I want to show you guys again here how to think of this strategy because it's kind of a complicated one, especially at first."

"What you guys see here is check twenty-seven percent of the time, bet small half the time, bet bigger twenty percent of the time."

"Almost without exception, what people do is they simplify to one bet size on the flop, so they would pick either the big one or the small one. That's why I kind of explain the principles of the big bet and the small bet."

### Simplification Approach

"So, you would either be starting out to bet small with everything. Why do I think that we can bet small with everything? Well, we're betting small and big for a combination of seventy-four percent. Almost every hand in our range is sometimes betting."

"And there are a few exceptions, there are hands here that never bet. You can always click this button strategy plus EV. This is going to show you the actual numbers."

### Understanding Suit Effects

"What you might see here is... Now look at King Eight of spades. At the bottom of the screen you'll see that it gives you a number for each action and it actually betting this hand loses you a small amount of money in theory."

"There's a reason why and it's a special reason for three bet pots, but also in general. We talked about how important backdoor draws are. Well, when we bet on Ten Four Three, our opponent is mainly continuing with two diamonds or with a club with all of his hands that missed the board."

"That means he's mostly folding hands with spades and hearts. So when we hold two spades or two hearts, or a spade and a heart, those hands are not doing that great. And again, if you look at Ace Eight with a spade and a heart, those hands also prefer to not bet."

### Practical Simplification

"What I would do on a board like this to simplify is I would bet something between one third and two thirds. Let's say one third with every single hand in my range except hands which are two spades, two hearts, or a spade and a heart."

"That's a fairly simplified strategy compared to what's going on here. And you might have all sorts of questions about it and of course feel free to ask, but trust me, it's been tested and developed and this is something a lot of people recommend."

"So, rather than do this complicated strategy, what we take away is we get to be a lot. It's between one thirds and two thirds. Kind of go through this. You're like, the only hands that really don't bet, everything is kind of okay-ish to bet, but hands with both a spade and a heart, and nothing, might have a bit of trouble betting."

"A hand like Ace Eight of spades, King Eight of spades, those hands don't do too well. So we could kind of fudge it and say 'I'll bet everything, I'll check those trashy hands' and then 'no, it's not ideal but it's close enough.' So we'd start with that. That is how I would treat and take information from these."

### High Card Boards in Three-Bet Pots

"Now if you ask me, what do I do with Ace King when it comes some disconnected and high board? I'd say, bet. What do you do with Ace Queen? Bet. What do you do with King Queen? Bet. What do you do with Seven Eight suited? Well, depends on your suits, right?"

"This is, of course, only flop. So you're going through these. We want to go through turns and rivers. Of course here we can look at if we bet because it's a drill. So it's going to be we bet and pot raise. But you can use this program actually to go through the entire simulation. So yeah, this is how I would look at this and we'll stop there."

## Hand Example 2: King-High Board

### Recommended Study Approach

"Hey guys, back to the same situation. Big blind versus button, three bet pot. It's very, very tempting first time you get this program to just drill, drill, drill and see how you're doing."

"Now, I'm not going to do that because I know how to play these spots. But I will say I don't think that's the best way of studying. Of course, have fun, knock yourself out, do fifty hands and see how your score is."

"But really what the process I would recommend, and the one that works for me, is to be like, drill and then look and see, do I understand what's going on? Another hand and then look and see, do I understand what's going on? And build up this conceptual framework so that you know what to do more and more. I already have that."

### Playing Middle Pair

- **Flop (K♦6♣4♣):** "three bet pot, big blind check to us"
- **Hand:** "we have Six Seven of diamonds"

"So, here we have three bet pot, big blind check to us and we have Six Seven of diamonds."

"I know that when you have a hand like this, like a middle pair and your opponent checks to you, the hand can actually bet or check and it can bet any size that leads it to what we call an appropriate pot size for the hand."

### Evaluating Options

"What do I mean by this? Well, Six Seven of diamonds. This is just some intuition I want you guys to develop. What are the benefits of checking? Well, it's not a very strong hand. Let's see a turn, maybe we improve."

"Also, keep our opponent's range wide in terms of, you know, we talked about the sweet spot of we want to have as much equity as possible as his range narrows. That's not very good for Six Seven."

"Now, the counter to that would be, if you can bet and make him fold two overcards, that's pretty great for you, so a small bet is kind of effective at doing this because it only narrows his range a little bit, but the part that folds, even though you were ahead of it, has decent equity against you."

"That's generally an option for this hand. And then, the bigger bets usually don't work too well, so it's mostly check or bets small. Maybe bet medium and never bet huge."

### Using the Randomizer

"I just need to click the buttons to change the bet size. But here we see, oh, this is an aggressive action, so we might click bet small."

"And what we'd see here is kind of like I was saying, it mostly checks. Sometimes it's bets small or medium and it never bets big."

### Turn Decision

- **Turn (A♥):** "the Ace, of course, makes our hand much, much worse"
- **River (4♦):** "Four. Check to us"

"Now, the Ace is kind of an interesting card. After we bet and got called, the Ace, of course, makes our hand much, much worse. We're very rarely winning at this point."

"And then the question you should ask yourself is, does it make sense to bluff this hand and try to get my opponent to fold like Queens, Jacks, Tens, Nines types of hands? Or is this just shrug and showdown?"

"My answer would be, I'm not sure. I feel like shrug and showdown is definitely okay. And the bluff, I wouldn't be sure. And again, we can check with the program, so it says be pretty aggressive, but let's say we click check and you see, oh, it's always check."

"See a river and play the hand through. Four. Check to us and of course now we always check because we are sometimes winning against Four Five or chopping against Six Seven, so no reason to bet."

"Our opponent had Nines, so we should have bluffed. Bluffing would've worked. But the point again here to me is always click review hand and test your intuition."

### Analyzing Checking Ranges

"So we go back to the flop and we're like, 'our opponent check, what does he even check with?' Again, you see the simplified structure and if you remember the last hand that we had, you might say to yourself, 'well, is he just checking, first of all, with spades and hearts and hands like that?'"

"And the answer would be, kind of, yeah, like Jack Nine of spades, Ace Nine of hearts. All sorts of hands with spades and hearts are checking. He also checks some traps, right? So, some Aces, some Kings, but all these hands mostly bets. Some Queens."

"And we have this checking range which we're imagining of. It's going to have some give ups with hearts that we really want to fold out with Six Seven and have a bunch of pocket pairs and some traps."

### Playing Defensively on King-High Boards

"And we might ask, 'well, what would I do with another hand once he checks?' And kind of go through this because everything here make sense."

"You mostly check back Sevens through Queens and actually check back quite a lot of Kings. That might be surprising to you. It's certainly surprising to me."

"So we always pause and we ask ourselves, 'really? We play that defensively once he checks to us?' And the answer in theory is kind of, 'well, it's a King high board and a three bet pot. You're not supposed to put in tons of money unless you have a set or two pair.'"

"Sets and two pairs do a lot of betting, but just a top pair... Just play defensive. Try to babysit your weaker hands to show down and be happy your opponent checked."

## Key Takeaways

### Focus on Structure, Not Memorization

"Again, look at the structure, there's a lot to dig into in these programs, which is why me and the other coaches are going to do our best to guide you through them."

"Definitely no, don't go to the memorization route. You can always be like, 'why does Tens bet more with these suits or less with those suits?' But only ask yourself that question at the very, very advanced stage. I don't even know the answer to that question. And I've been doing this for a very long time."

"Focus on the big picture, on the structure, because you're going to get a different board and a different bet size and a different stack size in practice. And these things are very sensitive, so we really want to be like, 'oh, King high board, my opponent checked'. I actually play kind of defensive."

"I take my very best hands, I take some bluffs, you guys can see which bluffs, and we go through that. But kind of stop there."
