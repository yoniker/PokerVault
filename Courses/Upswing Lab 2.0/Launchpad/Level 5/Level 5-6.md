My summary: add river overbets as part of my strategy. If i don't think they call then at least bluff with it. But I need to add it, either way (either they call too much and i get value or they almost never call and i can bluff a ton)

# Overbetting and River All-Ins

## Core Concepts

### The Challenge of Big River Bets

"Hey guys, this is going to be about overbetting and making big all ends on the river."

"Generally speaking, this is something everyone's aware that they should do, but it's kind of hard to get right in practice."

### Historical Context

"So, the history of big-all-end bets on the river is that before solvers, most people never really used to go beyond the size of the pot."

"Once solvers came into the picture and we realized we should, it was still kind of difficult to do it because what ends up happening is very often when you're on the river with the nuts, you don't want to go all-in because if you do, you have this feeling your opponent's never calling you."

"And when you're on the river with a bluff, you don't want to go all-in because it's scary to risk so much to win so little, so you end up just never doing it."

### The Logic of Overbetting

"Now, the important thing about this is that it's kind of either one or the other. So either you should go all-in with your good hands and people will call you, or you should do it with your bluffs because people never call you."

"And if you never start doing it, you never find out."

### Mathematical Foundation

"So, what I want to tell you guys is that the reason for going all-in and for making big river bets being good is kind of fundamental to the math of poker."

"And I'm not going to show that math in this video, even though it's very simple math. But with a balanced strategy, you just capture more of the pot size, more of the pot share by going with bigger bets."

## Practical Implementation

### Start Experimenting

"What I'd recommend to you guys, really, really strongly, is just try. Try going all-in as a bluff on the river. Try doing it with value. Try doing both. Just do it a lot."

"You'll get known as someone who does it. And then you won't have to worry about 'if I do this with this good hand people are always folding.' It just becomes a part of your game."

"It's an important part of the game. It's going to make you a much tougher player to deal with and as you start doing this, you'll notice that some players actually never call."

### Real-World Example

"I once made it big overbet and someone just showed me a set and folded face up and it was like, 'you're so dumb dude.' And I actually just had a bluff."

## Key Takeaways

### Identifying Player Types

"So yeah, some guys are never going to call you. And if the guys who do are guys who call you light, you can then adjust and start being more value-heavy against them."

### Final Recommendations

"But I would heavily recommend you experiment with this and don't feel shy about it."

"And keep in mind that if you don't feel like you can do it with your good hands, at least try doing it with your bluffs."
