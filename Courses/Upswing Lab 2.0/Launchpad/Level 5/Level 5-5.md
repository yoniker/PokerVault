# GTO vs Exploitative Poker

## Core Concepts

### Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Poker

"GTO poker. Game Theory Optimal poker means playing like the solver output, which would mean betting two combos of Aces with one combo of Deuces, having the correct betting range and the correct checking range."

"The idea of game theory is to kind of strive to go there. And as long as you're kind of there, this is what's called an unbeatable strategy in the sense that it has no weaknesses, so it doesn't in itself generate a ton of money, but it's a very, very strong baseline."

### Exploitative Poker

"And exploitative poker on the other hand, is adjusting to your opponent's mistakes. For example, noticing that your opponent isn't betting enough Deuces and then folding more, it would be an exploit."

### The Contradiction

"The interesting relationship between game theory poker and exploitative poker is that there's sort of a contradiction, because in order to exploit someone, you have to not play correctly. You have to throw your frequencies out the window to take advantage of him."

"And then so doing you become vulnerable, your strategy becomes vulnerable. It's no longer two combos Aces, one combo Deuces. Suddenly your opponent could make a big counter adjustment to you."

## Different Approaches

### The Spectrum of Styles

"So different coaches and different players lean in a different way in terms of where are they willing to deviate and by how much, how effort they put into, on the one hand playing game theory optimal poker versus, on the other hand, spotting their opponent's mistakes and taking advantage of them by playing unbalanced exploitative poker. These are kind of the two terms."

### The Speaker's Approach

"Now, I have a course about exploitative cash game strategies on Upswing. I'm certainly in the camp of 'you should be very actively looking at your opponents and looking for their mistakes and looking for opportunities to exploit them.'"

"But that being said, I have a very strong game theory foundation and it's very easy for me when I don't see anything to just be like, shrug, 'okay, I'll just play properly here and no worries.'"

### Both Styles Can Succeed

"So, I feel like any strong poker player should have a decent foundation in both of these, but you will see very successful players who specialize in one much more than the other."

"Some guys are much more theory oriented and some guys are much more exploit oriented and you can actually succeed with both styles."

## Key Takeaways

### Choosing Your Focus Based on Games

"I will say that generally speaking, in softer player pools, recognizing mistakes and taking advantage of them is going to lead you to a higher win rate than focusing your energy on playing theoretically optimal. But they're both going to lead to fairly high win rates if you do them well. And the main question is, do you do them well? And where does your heart lie? Because there have been successful poker players with both, so don't feel forced into one camp or the other. I highly recommend you just kind of study and improve with both. And I think they're both fascinating and they compliment each other very well.
