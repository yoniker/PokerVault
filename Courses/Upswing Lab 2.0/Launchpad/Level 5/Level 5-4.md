# RNG and Randomization in Poker

## Core Concepts

### What is RNG?

"So  RNG and RNG is a random number generator,kind of like rolling a dice or flipping a coin."

"And the reason people use these in poker is that the optimal strategies are a bit deceptive."

### Mixed Strategies

"So very often with the same hand, you might take some action some of the time and another action another amount of the time."

"So for example, if we look at a board like, uh, 9, 8, 7 two-tone that we have here from the previous videos and we think about the flop and we're like, well, what do we do with our nut flush draws? The answer is gonna be, we're gonna bet them sometimes and check them sometimes."

## Practical Implementation

### Using Random Number Generators

"And so what a lot of players will do is they will have, it's called an RNG Random Number generator, I'll show you guys what that looks like."

"Here. You can type in Google random number generator and say one to a hundred, and they'll say on one to 50, I'll bet 51 to a hundred, check, it's 28- so bet."

### Strategic Benefits

"And this allows them to play a deceptive strategy where it's not clear what they're doing and really something, since a lot of the guys you play against don't use random number generators, it is actually gonna be clear what they're doing."

## Key Takeaways

### Exploiting Non-Randomizers

"So pay attention to that. Especially weaker players might always bet with their draws or always bet with their good hands rather than do this and that makes them face up in a bit exploitable."

"Which leads us into the subject of the next video."
