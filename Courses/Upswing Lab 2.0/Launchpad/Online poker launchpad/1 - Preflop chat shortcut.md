My summary: It's ok in theory and practice to either call or fold small pps/suited connectors, and that's by 'design' of the 3-bet range and sizing. It's ok to base the decision - if the other guy is stronger or weaker of a player than me.
# Preflop Ranges Crash Course

## Core Concepts

### Hand Similarities and Position-Based Range Construction

"The thing that I always think about is lots of hands are similar to each other. So sixes and fives are similar. Six seven suited and five six suited are similar. Ace queen off suit and ace jack off suit are similar."

"I always try to think about, well if this is the range for one position, the next position is gonna have a few more, like one rank lower of similar types of hands. So if this is UTG and this is in a nine handed table, go UTG plus one, suddenly Ace Jack Offsuit, king, queen Offsuit six, five suited appear go UTG plus two pocket fives go to low jack. We might expect these to appear and even if they don't, I wouldn't mind if you put them in, but yeah, they're gonna come in there so it kind of widens by hand category."

"Every position has kind of most hand categories getting a bit wider every jump you make. So that's one kind of useful shortcut to read into these ranges is you remember one of them and then when you're in a tighter position, you go one tick tighter, looser position, one tick looser for opening."

### Three-Bet Response Ranges

"In terms of what do you do when someone already opens? Generally speaking it's very, very similar. So you guys can see if we're UTG versus UTG plus one, we're gonna go nine plus a 10 suited plus a screen. And then as we kind of go to further positions, whether it's for us or for him, you'll see this widen. And the reason for that is there are less people behind you who can wake up with a good hand."

"This is kind of the way I think of it is you have your high pairs and your good suited broadways, which always continue. And then how many of the other pocket pairs, other suited connectors, other suited aces, other off Broadways? There's a mix that gets wider and wider."

### Edge Cases and Precision

"It's not important to get it accurately. That's very important for me to mention for you guys because it doesn't matter if you get five six suited in seven eight or you know here there's all three of these here, there's none of these. But imagine in your head that they're almost there here and they're almost not there here. So it's not a black and white thing, it's more of a spectrum of how much money are they making, how much money are they losing?"

"So don't worry about edge cases, you don't have to catch these correctly, at least in the start and as you start playing with this stuff, you'll just get used to it. A little bit instinct."

### Three-Bet Defense Theory

"People like set mining and they like mining with suited connectors. And so the theoretical three bet ranges and sizes are always gonna make you kind of indifferent with your low pairs, your suited aces, your suited connectors, all those hands are always gonna be close."

"The theoretical strategies are designed to not let you set mine and not let you suited connector mine. So that to me was a really important understanding because it kind of led me to say, oh well you know, if you three bet me and I have fives, it's never a big mistake to call and it's never a big mistake to fold."

"Our low pairs and our suited connectors and our bad suited broadways are the borderline hands and anything worse becomes a clear fold and, and we all know king queen offsuit is worse than fives in any type situation as conceive in king 10 suited ace, 10 suited."

### Mixed Strategies and Zero EV Hands

"When you see green and blue mix means zero ev, which means you might as well have folded and then you know, if you think the other guy's stronger than you, if you're tired, whatever you want to end your session, don't force yourself into these."

"There's this thing in poker, right where nine suited is a top 20% hand. So you don't get it super often and When you get it, you want to play with it. But like we mentioned in the past, the fact that it's playable doesn't mean that you have to play it through that it makes you money. Playable is just above power, just a tad above the water."

### Player-Dependent Adjustments

"I generally call them against guys who I think are a bit weaker than me, which is a lot of guys I play with. But when I play against someone who I think is stronger than me, I'll fold these hands in a heartbeat and I won't look back. So I'd give that out to you guys as well. If you feel like there's this good regular in your game and he's three betting, you don't feel like you have to call these hands like they're not making money."

## Key Takeaways

"So feel super free to fold these, I generally call them against guys who I think are a bit weaker than me, which is a lot of guys I play with."

"Mixed means foldable, basically to me, callable or foldable. So hope that helps to simplify uh, going through the charts and like I said, play, go through the charts after you'll get there. There's not that many things in six max or nine max to remember."

"This is basically to get you guys to a big picture understanding as soon as possible... you kind of need to do your homework on these at some point, but this is basically to get you guys to a big picture understanding as soon as possible."
