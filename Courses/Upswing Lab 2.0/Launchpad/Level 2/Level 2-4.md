# How to Play Top Pair Weak Kicker

## Core Concepts

"The idea with top pair weak kicker is we have a strong hand but it's not strong enough where if tons of money goes in we're still ahead."

"So these types of hands often play a little bit defensive. They don't let go easily, but they do if tons and tons of money goes in or a bad runout comes out and they're very good at winning small to medium sized pots."

"And generally if the pot gets very big, you're not very happy about your hand at that point anymore."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: Button with A9s - Pot Controlling

**Preflop:** "We raise Ace Nine suited on the button, our opponent calls the big blind."

**Flop (7♠ A♥ 8♣):** "Nice, top pair. Decent kicker but not great. We decide to check back. Like I said, these top pairs do a lot of checking, This is called pot controlling. They're not aiming for a huge pot."

**Turn (8♥):** "So now our hand gets a bit devalued. We make a small bet that gets called."

**River (Q♥):** "So the backdoor flush came in. And also this runout means that our Ace is chopping with any other Ace. So if we bet now it's actually not that easy to get called by worse. We chop with an Ace, we lose the flush draws, we lose the slow-played trips, we beat a Seven or a pocket pair. So we do still decide to go for it but realizing this is on the thin side."

**Result:** "And get the fold"

### Hand 2: Defending BB with J9

**Preflop:** "Our opponent raises. We defend the big blind with Jack Nine."

**Flop (3♦ J♥ 6♦):** "Flop top pair low kicker and again we're hoping he doesn't put tons of money in. So when he checks back, we're thrilled."

**Turn (4♥):** "We get the Four of hearts turn. Low, connected turn. But given we're the caller this turn favors us, we have more low cards and given our opponent check back, he's less likely to have a flush. So our hand is worth one to two bets but definitely not happy if we get raised or face a lot of action. So we decide to check, see a safe river first."

**River (A♦):** "We see a bad river, an Ace. And now this is just a check-and-hope hand, which is what happens."

**Result:** "And we check down and win versus King high."

### Hand 3: Defending K4s vs Button

**Preflop:** "Our opponent raises button, we defend King Four suited."

**Flop (7♣ K♦ 6♦):** "Got a King Six Seven two-tone board. So again, top pair but tons of bad runouts are possible and so let's just hope our opponent doesn't put lots of money in so he checks back. That's great."

**Turn (8♥):** "Turn connects the board, our hand could bet or check. We decide to check again, happy to call his bet and if our opponent makes a big bet on the river, we might have to call depending on the runout, but we're not going to be happy about it."

**River (9♦):** "So we get the river Nine, four to a straight. Our top pair got immensely devalued when it's four to a straight. We now only beat bluff so we check and happily our opponent checks back with Ace Eight."

### Hand 4: Button with K7 - Value Raising Gone Wrong

**Preflop:** "We raise button with King Seven, we get called."

**Flop (9♣ K♦ 2♥ rainbow):** "King Nine Deuce rainbow board. Check to us, we bet small and get called."

**Turn (3♦):** "Turn Three. Now we can either bet and check back the river, or we can check and try to catch a bluff or a thin value bet on the river. The more common line is to check back, but they're both fine. And against the more passive opponent, you would do more betting, so we check back."

**River (4♦):** "Four of diamonds on the river. So backdoor flush came in, but our hand is fairly strong at this point. Our opponent bets small and our hand is actually close to being worth a raise, right? Assuming he would bet better hands bigger most of the time. So we do raise and our opponent calls and he was trapping us with set."

**Result:** "And yeah, we basically would not have raised the bigger bet. So he played it perfectly against our hand. Had  he bet bigger, we just call. When he bets this small, he's kind of telling us that our hand is good, so we do put in the raise unfortunately." (Opponent had 3♣3♠)

### Hand 5: Button with 98o - Betting for Protection

**Preflop:** "We raise button get called by the small blind"

**Flop (5♣ 3♦ 8♣):** "We flop top pair with a weak kicker. But given it's a low board, this pair is much more incentivized to bet. It's both stronger and that it's tougher to make a pair on these low boards, so the kicker is not as important."

"And also we're more happy to see our opponent just fold random overcards because King Nine Deuce, a lot of his hands are drawing very thin against our pair of Kings. But here he might have something like Jack Ten or King Ten and we'd be happy to see those fold. So he checks, we bet half pot, he calls."

**Turn (Q♠):** "Turn Queen of spades. And at this point our hand is similar to the King Seven. You could check turn and look for a river bet, you can bet again and check down. But this medium pot size is what's repeating itself for these top-pair-medium-kicker hands. So our opponent checks, we check back."

**River (6♠):** "River Six, he checks. Now our hand is worth a bet so we bet. And he actually trapped us with a better kicker and that's life."

**Result:** "That's why they call it 'a thin value bet', because it's ahead but it doesn't beat everything." (Opponent had J♠8♠)

## Key Takeaway

"A lot of these are going to be very undramatic" - Top pair weak kicker hands excel at winning small to medium pots through pot control, but struggle when facing heavy action or bad runouts.
