# Playing Pocket Kings - Strategy Guide


When I get dealt KK I have this rush of, something good has happened, i'm going to win money here. But what do I do on bad boards, like Ah9h8h? In poker I need to constantly re-evaluate the hand strength, based on actions, runout and more.

**Key Principle:** Pocket Kings is a premium pre-flop hand, but its value is entirely context-dependent post-flop. Success requires constant reevaluation based on board texture and opponent actions.

> "Just because you got kings doesn't mean it's gonna win a big pot. Everything is dependent on everything else."

## Hand Value Categories Post-Flop

### 1. **Super Premium**

- Overpair on disconnected rainbow boards
- Top set 


### 2. **Still Strong**

- Overpair on moderately safe boards

### 3. **Medium Strength**

- When an Ace appears
- On highly connected/coordinated boards
- **Strategy:** Pot control, defensive play

### 4. **Bluff Catcher**

- When facing significant aggression on dangerous boards
- Multiple overcards or completed draws
- **Strategy:** Call selectively, minimize losses

## Key Strategic Concepts

### Constant Reevaluation

- **Pre-flop:** Premium hand, raise/reraise for value
- **Flop:** Assess board texture immediately
- **Turn/River:** Adjust based on new cards and opponent actions

### Position Matters

- **Out of Position:** Mix checks with strong hands to balance range
- **In Position:** More flexibility to control pot size

## Example Hands

### Hand 1:

CO opens, I 3-bet with KcKs, CO calls. Board comes Qc4c4d
Amazing board for Kings. When I re-raise my opponent, he's less likely to have low cards after calling, but also just a four miss him a lot.
So we're not losing to very much. We very often are ahead. We want to get tons of money in
and we decide to start out with a check because you know we're out of position. And when You're out of position, you need
to be a bit tricky sometimes you can't just only check weak hands and only bet strong hands. So we check our opponent bets small
and we're like, okay, let's go for it. Let's check raise. We have kings. He calls. Turn is six of clubs. There's now a flush on the board.
Kings is a lot less strong. Now if we put in a stack with kings, we probably would not be far ahead,
but it's still ahead, right? Our opponent could still have a lower pair with clubs or or just a queen.
So we bet small (20BB into 60BB pot), our opponent makes a small raise(to 42BBs) and now we have the instantly reevaluate because like we said,
kings is a beautiful hand pre flop , great flop, dangerous turn. And suddenly our opponent wakes up and he's telling a story of our kings is beat.
If he's  re-raising like this, I probably have something like a flush. And now our beautiful, beautiful kings ran into a situation
where it's now playing defense. It's a bluff catcher, it's not such a great hand. So we would call because we can improve to a flush
or we can improve to a boat with two kings and and it's not a big raise, but in your head the evaluation has to shift,
the excitement has to drop. We're now playing in the real world. Kings is not that special given the action and the runout.
So we call river ace of diamonds. I think the ace of diamonds makes what was already evident on the turn even more visible
because even on the turn our opponent would not have been raising us with just a queen. So the fact that there is an ace there, it drives home the fact that your kings is just beating bluffs at this point. So while on the turn we could improve,
now it's just beating bluffs. We now lose the bluffs that had an ace. But how many people bluff with an ace?
So it didn't change much, it just makes it more self-evident. So we check our opponent checks back and we lose the four five suited and we find out we're actually beat on the flop, believe it or not.

### Hand 2

Cutoff raises, we get  our premium Kings we re raise.
He calls, flop comes Td9dTc, So we lose to trips. But we are fairly well ahead with Kings and
unless our opponent shows us he has trips through his actions, we're gonna start building the pot with kings. So we make small bet, he calls,
and we get the turn Ace in this situation, how do you play Kings? Well, the only reason there is a dissonance there,
And the only reason there's a question is the emotional charge Kings has and the fact that we expect to win with Kings.
'cause if I asked you how do you play with something like 88 here you would say check. How do you play with something like, I dunno, Jh9h,
you'd say Check now Kings is a bit better than those hands, but it's not that much better. So it can either check or bet small.
Those are the options and if it faces a lot of action, you're gonna have a tough decision. And the fact that your hand has two kings is not gonna be
too relevant anymore. So here we choose the bet, small kind of pot controlling, we're really hoping not to get raised
or for our opponent to call and for him to check back the river.  Any more money than this going in, And We're definitely in trouble, but our opponent folds. And this is the good scenario for KK here, which just shows you how weak kings is that you bet so small
and you really hope he folds. 

### Hand 3:
Now we're blind versus blind. We raise kings and we get called board comes A66 rainbow.
So immediately we're losing to an ace, we're losing to a six very unexciting situation with kings and we immediately reevaluate
and we say, you know, I have a hand that wants a smallish pot. It doesn't really need protection so I'm gonna make small bets
or just try to check it down and, and that's it. So here we check our opponent bets small, we're gonna call Kings.
We check the jack turn, he checks back, we get the four river. Now we either bet small and hope, he calls with a jack
or we can check let him sometimes bluff, we decide to check, he checks back with pocket threes and we win a small pot, which is really the ideal situation
with Kings on this kind of board. A small pot is the sweet spot once you get a bad board like this.
And that's what we would be aiming for. 


### Hand 4

So here we open with Kings LJ, CO three bet BB cold 4-bets, loose players. So we decide to go for a five bet with Kings. Against some people we might even get outta the way,
but these are fairly loose players. We get a great board Queen five, five, two-tone. Of course we are losing to a five.
Our opponent could have something like Ace five suited or four five suited. We are losing to pocket queens. We're losing to slow play AAs,
but so much money's in, we can't really worry about that too much(71BB effective is 110BB). He checks to us, we bet small.
He calls turns six of spades, two flush draws, he checks, we bet he calls River seven of diamonds, 66
and 77 don't matter too much given a pre-flop action. So we go all in and our opponent calls us with TT.
And you'll note in this hand our opponent gave us no reason to think he has us beat at any point
and we play it appropriately.

### Hand 6
Here we re raise with Kings, we get a Qs3s5d, two-tone board. So we are losing to some hands, but definitely well ahead.
Our opponent leads out and we decide to raise, he calls Turn king of diamonds. So we have top set, very dynamic board,
throw in another bet which gets called River jack of club. So we now lose if he had Ace 10 with a flash draw
or ten nine with a flash draw. But certainly well ahead we go all in and get unfortunate fold. But yeah, we're gonna have some hands like
these with Kings as well where we want to put in all of the money. These are the easy ones to play. Hopefully this helps you with the tougher ones.


## Summary

Playing Pocket Kings successfully requires:

- **Emotional detachment** from pre-flop excitement
- **Board texture awareness**
- **Flexibility** in adjusting hand strength evaluation
- **Discipline** to fold when clearly beat
- **Patience** to play small pots when appropriate

Remember: The goal isn't to win every pot with Kings, but to maximize value in favorable situations while minimizing losses in unfavorable ones.
