# When Hands Don't Go As Planned

## The Date Analogy

"What does it mean when a hand doesn't go as planned? I think this is a very important subject and one that has to do with both poker and life."

"So let's say you have a date with a girl and you talk to her before you really like her. You go on the date and you are planning on going to the park. It's stormy weather, it's raining, it's starting to snow, there's thunder, there's lightning that you are planning to go to the park, right? It was a beautiful day. You have your picnic basket, everything planned out."

"What do you do when things don't go as planned? Fairly simple. You change your plans, right? No going to the park. If you do go to the park as a date, it's not gonna end well for you. This story is how poker works."

## The Core Principle

"So when a hand doesn't go as planned, the first and most important thing to do is to recognize, oh, this isn't going as planned. Let's slow down, let's reevaluate. Let's consider my options and let's understand that things are not gonna pan out the way I thought."

## Poker Examples

### Example 1: Pocket Queens Under the Gun

"For example, you look down at Pocket Queens under the gun and your plan is to raise and have an advantage in a nice spot, and you do raise and the guy on the cutoff three bets you. And now your plan is maybe to re raise him back and start playing, but then the guy on the button re raises him and the guy on the small blind re raises him and you're like, oh wow, this isn't going as planned, right?"

"And suddenly you have to reevaluate your queens and you realize, given the context of everything that happened, queens, with every action ,shifted, right? So it started out being a top 2% hand and anyone can have anything. And then it was a 2% hand facing, maybe an 8%, three betting range. And then it was a 2% hand facing, an 8%, three betting range, and a 3% cold, four betting range. And now another cold five betting range added, which is probably like one, one and a half percent of hands."

"And suddenly you're like, oh wow, Queens is actually terrible here. This is a really easy fold. But you have to follow the weather. You have to follow the signs and kind of see how plans change."

### Example 2: Top Pair Facing Aggression

"And the same is true for after the flop. So say the board comes King five six, and you have King Jack or King Queen or Ace King, you make a bet and your opponent makes a big raise and puts a big bet."

"And on the turn he puts another big bet, it's very, very important that you reevaluate how strong your hand is and you're able to recognize it, at what point plans have changed. And rather than having a hand that wants a big pot, it's your opponent that's telegraphing a bigger pot than your hand is appropriate for. And folding suddenly becomes an option for you."

## The Key Takeaway

"So whenever things don't go as planned, the most important thing is slow down, reevaluate, consider all your options. And you know there's always another hand, there's always another date. With a girl, you're gonna have good weather. It's fine to fold good hands and poker, that's part of the game."
