# How to Play Ace King

## Core Concepts

"Ace King is a very deceptive poker hand in that it's one of the top possible hands, but there's a sharp drop off between Aces and Kings and Ace King."

"Ace King is not a made hand, so whenever you don't flop an Ace or a King, your hand is actually more of a draw or weak showdown than something premium."

"The main tricky thing with Ace King is again managing the dissonance between... Ace King overall and everything together and it's a premium, but your profit gets split into the times where you flop an Ace or a King and you're doing great or the times when you don't and then it's difficult to maneuver and the hand kind of under realizes its equity, it underperforms compared to how strong it is."

"The best hands, such as overpairs, top pair top kicker, are going to overperform because money going in is good for you. Whereas something like Ace High, it's tough for it to overperform unless you can read your opponent's soul. You're mostly just going to have tough decisions or your opponent's going to realize his equity or things like that."

"The main thing with Ace King is to tell these two situations apart and recognize how to play each one."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: Button vs Big Blind - Missing the Flop

**Preflop:** "We open Ace King on the button, our opponent calls big blind"

**Flop (T♦ 2♠ 7♣ rainbow):** "This is a board where Ace King can either check or bet small to medium and then try to show down. Those would generally be the two options. If you bet big with it, you're kind of destroying the showdown value of your hand. And in this wide range button versus big blind spot that's a shame. So we check back."

**Turn (J♠):** "Our opponent bets, we have two overcards, so a draw to top pair top kicker, a draw to the nut straight... We might win with Ace high, so we have a very easy call."

**River (3♥):** "We really hope our opponent checks and we get to check down and win versus a busted draw. If he bets, we're going to have a tough decision and he does bet."

"At this stage we realize our Ace King is only beating bluffs, so we might as well have something like Ace Deuce or pocket Fours. And it's important that you visualize that, because there's an emotional attachment with hands like Ace King, but your Ace King isn't Ace King anymore. It's just an Ace high that beats bluffs and the fact that it used to be premium and it used to have potential doesn't matter anymore."

"You should be just as likely to call something like Ace King on the river as something like Ace Deuce or pocket Fours, et cetera. There are some nuances to which is better, but it's not necessarily Ace King being the best one there."

**Result:** "In this case we call and we beat Queen Nine"

### Hand 2: Deep Stack 3-Bet Pot from Big Blind

**Preflop:** "Our opponent raises from the button. We're very deep, we re-raise huge from the big blind and he calls"

"We're well aware that this is going to diverge into two, if we hit, we're going to pile money, and if we miss, it's going to be a difficult situation to manage and there are a lot of bad outcomes for us."

**Flop (2♥ 3♥ 5♦):** "We have a gut shot to the second nut straight and two overcards. And the board being lower our opponent misses it often. So Ace King is a reasonable hand here but not very strong. We start with a check and then call a small bet from our opponent."

**Turn (A♦):** "We turn the Ace of diamonds, but given there is four to a straight and we lose to all of the wheel Aces, which would be Ace Deuce, Ace Three, Ace Four, Ace Five, our Ace... Top pair top kicker is not that strong. Remember the strength of a pair is connected to the board as well. We decide to lead out small, our opponent calls."

**River (6♠):** "Six doesn't change a lot. Four was a straight anyway. So we now lose to Five Six suited and Sixes. We throw another small bet and hoping our opponent calls and doesn't raise. If he raises we're probably toast and he does raise."

"Once he raises, we very quickly realize our Ace King might as well be an Ace Seven or a Six Seven suited. Or just something that beats bluffs, a pocket Eights. It's no longer the premium Ace King we thought it was. And this is going to happen very often guys with hands like Ace King. And that's why this video is so important."

"So we throw the emotional attachment away. Just imagine you have a hand like King Deuce, do you want to call this raise? Probably not. So probably fold here versus most people and versus some guys you decide to be a hero and make a hero call."

**Result:** "This case we do and we get shown the bad news with our opponent rivering a set, but we were behind on the flop as well. And very lucky, a four didn't roll out and then it would've been straight over straight."

### Hand 3: Perfect Runout (Holding A♦K♠)

**Preflop:** "We raise Ace King, we get called from the big blind"

**Flop (T♦ A♥ 9♠ rainbow):** "Nice Ace Ten Nine rainbow board. We're going to start piling in money, but we're well aware that if the board comes a Nine or a Ten or a Jack or a Queen, even an Eight or running flush cards, we're going to have to tread carefully. So not all runouts are the same. Of course ideally it comes something like Deuce Three. So we start with a bet, our opponent calls."

**Turn (4♣):** "Beautiful rainbow Four. So we make a big bet. Way ahead, still our opponent calls."

**River (K♣):** "So we have our top two. Perfect runout. We make a pot size bet and our opponent, unfortunately for him, rivered King Ten."

"This is the good easy scenario with Ace King, right? Beautiful runout, but not always that easy."

### Hand 4: Blind vs Blind 3-Bet Pot (Holding A♥K♥)

**Preflop:** "Blind versus blind, we three bet Ace King"

**Flop (4h 5d 9d two-tone):** "Our opponent checks and here Ace King can bet or check, but the main thing to realize is it's not a premium hand anymore. This might... It's stronger than King Queen, but it's not anything special. It's way weaker than something like Nine Eight or Six Seven. Maybe even weaker than something like Seven Eight. I think it's a bit stronger than Seven Eight. So yeah, we check back."

**Turn (8♥):** "So we have a flush draw. And now the value of our Ace King is mostly in the hearts rather than the fact that it was Ace King. Our opponent checks again and we're like, well we're really happy to see a river. We don't want to get check-raised. It's not like he's folding any pairs if we bet, so we check down."

**River (A♣):** "So luckily we improved for free, our opponent let us get here. Now our hand is strong enough to bet, so we fire out a bet knowing full well that if we get raised, our hand would be just a bluff-catcher and we might have to make a tough laydown."

**Result:** "Our opponent folds."

### Hand 5: Small Blind vs Under the Gun (Holding AK with A♦)

**Preflop:** "We call Ace King from the small blind versus under the gun. You can call this hand against tight opens, which you'll learn when we go through the preflop charts."

**Flop (4♦ 8♣ 7♦ two-tone):** "We get a bad board, Four Seven Eight two-tone. And here Ace King with the Ace of diamonds, you probably call once because you still beat bluffs. And if you improve to an Ace or a King, your opponent is likely to be aggressive on those cards. But yeah, we get to bet."

**Turn (Q♥):** "Of course we're checking again and he checks back."

**River (4♥):** "And there's not much point in putting in money really. We miss, we only beat bluffs. We really want to show down against Ace Jack or Ace Ten. So there's not much to do other than check down."

"We check and our opponent bets and now we can decide, do we call, do we fold, do we turn our hand into a bluff raise? But either way, it's a very marginal spot. Like I said, Ace King not very different than something like Ace Deuce or pocket Deuces here."

**Result:** "We decide to call and get shown the bad news - villian had AQ."
