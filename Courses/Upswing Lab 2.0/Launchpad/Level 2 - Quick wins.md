# Playing Pocket Kings - Strategy Guide


When I get dealt KK I have this rush of, something good has happened, i'm going to win money here. But what do I do on bad boards, like Ah9h8h? In poker I need to constantly re-evaluate the hand strength, based on actions, runout and more.

**Key Principle:** Pocket Kings is a premium pre-flop hand, but its value is entirely context-dependent post-flop. Success requires constant reevaluation based on board texture and opponent actions.

## Hand Value Categories Post-Flop

### 1. **Super Premium**

- Overpair on disconnected rainbow boards
- Top set 


### 2. **Still Strong**

- Overpair on moderately safe boards
- **Strategy:** Extract value but remain aware of dangers

### 3. **Medium Strength**

- When an Ace appears
- On highly connected/coordinated boards
- **Strategy:** Pot control, defensive play

### 4. **Bluff Catcher**

- When facing significant aggression on dangerous boards
- Multiple overcards or completed draws
- **Strategy:** Call selectively, minimize losses

## Key Strategic Concepts

### Constant Reevaluation

- **Pre-flop:** Premium hand, raise/reraise for value
- **Flop:** Assess board texture immediately
- **Turn/River:** Adjust based on new cards and opponent actions

### Position Matters

- **Out of Position:** Mix checks with strong hands to balance range
- **In Position:** More flexibility to control pot size

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Great Board (Q♠4♥4♦)

- Kings remain very strong
- Check-raise for value OOP
- Build large pot

### Scenario 2: Dangerous Turn Development

- **Flop:** Q-4-4 (strong)
- **Turn:** Flush completes (reevaluate)
- **Action:** Opponent raises = Kings becomes bluff catcher
- **Result:** Call turn, check-call river if reasonable

### Scenario 3: Ace-High Boards (A-10-9)

- Kings immediately devalued
- Options: Check or small bet for pot control
- Avoid building large pots

### Scenario 4: Paired Low Boards (6-6-x)

- Vulnerable to any Ace
- Small pot is ideal outcome
- Check-call small bets, avoid inflation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overvaluing pre-flop strength post-flop**
2. **Failing to adjust when board develops poorly**
3. **Building large pots on dangerous boards**
4. **Not recognizing when Kings becomes a bluff catcher**

## Winning with Kings

### Ideal Conditions:

- Disconnected boards
- Rainbow or single-tone textures
- No overcards
- Opponents showing weakness

### When to Go for Maximum Value:

- Hit top set
- Safe runouts with no completed draws
- Against opponents who can't fold top pair

## Summary

Playing Pocket Kings successfully requires:

- **Emotional detachment** from pre-flop excitement
- **Board texture awareness**
- **Flexibility** in adjusting hand strength evaluation
- **Discipline** to fold when clearly beat
- **Patience** to play small pots when appropriate

Remember: The goal isn't to win every pot with Kings, but to maximize value in favorable situations while minimizing losses in unfavorable ones.
