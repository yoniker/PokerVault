My summary: Always look at showdowns and know the baselines theory so I can recognize a surprising deviation. If a player is a station then value-bet him thin, if a player is nitty then bluff him a lot more...
# Adjusting to Stationy and Nitty Players

## Core Concepts

### Recognizing Player Tendencies

"As in addition to the previous videos about loose tables and nitty tables, I should mention, what do you do when a player is very stationy? Or the very nitty postflop in terms of loves to hero fold? Again, this is very straightforward but it's so, so important that pay attention to these things."

"Part of the ideas you learn in poker is you understand what should raise your eyebrows and what shouldn't, in terms of calling or bluffing or betting in general."

### Adjusting Against Stationy Players

"So, if you see someone make a very, very stationy call and he's not a very good player, the assumption should be that in his mind, the thresholds are calculated wrong, so he's going to call too much. The way you win against this player is by value betting bigger and wider and bluffing less. It's very straightforward."

### Reading Good vs Weak Players

"If he's a good player and he made a very loose call, you should be thinking about it a bit different and kind of ask yourself 'what might have led him to make this loose call? Is it some kind of read, timing read, physical read, or did he actually make a mistake?'"

"As we respect the player more, we give them credit for having reasons, and as we think that they're less proficient at poker, we think it's just their tendency and their misunderstanding, so we adjust faster."

### Exploiting Players Who Fold Too Much

"Similar guys who love folding a lot, you want to just put a lot of pressure on them all the time. Just keep repping the nuts, keep triple barreling, keep raising their weak looking bets and keep taking the dead money, so your strong hands are actually going to underperform. You don't want to be making very big, very thin value bets. It's mostly about your bluffs."

## Key Takeaways

### Against Stationy Players:

- Value bet bigger and wider
- Bluff less frequently
- Adjust faster against weaker players who have fundamental misunderstandings
- Question loose calls from good players - they may have specific reads

### Against Nitty/Folding Players:

- Apply constant pressure
- Triple barrel frequently
- Raise their weak-looking bets
- Focus on bluffs rather than thin value
- Accept that strong hands will underperform
- Avoid making big, thin value bets
