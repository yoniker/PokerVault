My summary:
The adjustment I should make - if they are just a bit looser then i should open a bit tighter, if they are very very loose (ATC) then i can widen up my range, regardless play a linear range, there's no point in opening Q4s if I have less fold equity.
# Adjusting to Very Splashy-Loose Tables

## Core Concepts

### The Basketball Metaphor Applied

"Okay, how to adjust at very splashy-loose tables. Again, think of the basketball metaphor from before. The fact that everyone's playing silly doesn't necessarily directly win you money. We want to actually adjust to it."

### Adjusting to Individual Loose Players

"Let's focus on a specific player. If a specific player is opening very loose, our adjustment is to play more hands and play them more aggressively against him. So let's say he's opening a button range of top forty percent of hands, but he's opening it under the gun nine-handed. The only adjustment you make is, you play as though he's opening this range. So, you would re-raise him wider, call him wider. That's it."

### The Limits of Exploitation

"There's no magic to it, right? A lot of these hands are losing him money, but they lose him a lot more money if you slightly widen your range. If you start spewing around with hands that shouldn't be there, they might not even lose him money. So it's not like 'he opened super wide. I can now re-raise him with Seven Deuce suited.' That's not how it works. It's more like 'he opened super wide. Okay, I can now re-raise him with Ace Jack', whereas before maybe it was a fold. Or Ace Ten."

### Quality Over Quantity

"One thing is we play looser, but with our good hands, not with our bad hands."

## Strategic Adjustments

### Opening Range Modifications

"Another thing is we open a bit tighter. So if the table is very splashy and loose, that means you're not getting preflop folds. Generally speaking, when we imagine our opening range, let's look now with UTG opening range of top twenty percent of hands. Again, not super accurate, but say you're opening something like this."

"So, something like this, and we already talked about how the hands at the margins are not making you a lot of money in theory, and a lot of the money they're making comes from people folding. So if people fold less, these hands start losing you money."

### The Spectrum of Looseness

"Of course, if they call everything, if they call you with Eight Three offsuit, these hands are actually winning a lot of money. But if they're just a bit splashier or medium splashier, but they don't play terrible hands, the first adjustment is to tighten up."

"If they're super duper, duper splashy, right? Like any-two-cards splashy, then you might even loosen up, because against any two cards, a lot more hands are actually winning you money."

### Position-Dependent Adjustments

"And again, it's this dance of if the table's a bit too loose, you want to open a bit tighter. If the table is way too loose, you maybe want to open a bit looser from the earlier positions and just go absolute hand strength. And maybe a bit tighter from later positions, right? There's no point opening like Queen Four suited, but definitely nice to have an Ace Nine or a Queen Ten against guys who are very loose."

### Postflop Realities

"This is preflop. Postflop what's going to happen at the splashy-loose table is you're going to get into a lot of multi-way pots. If you haven't, watch the video about multi-way pots."

"In these multi-way pots, you're going to have to give up and lose quite a lot. Even if you have Ace King or Ace Queen or pocket Nines, all these hands. And you just have to live with it. That's how multi-way pots work. You're not going to win most of them, even if you have the tighter range."

### Where the Edge Comes From

"But by virtue of playing better hands, you're more often going to outkick their top pairs, set-over-set them, flush-over-flush them, straight-over-straight them, two-pair-over-two-pair them. All the kind of coolers are going to be in your favor more."

"And of course, as I discussed on the multi-way video, people are going to kind of overplay their hands. So bluff less, value bet more, be a bit tight when people bet, and you should be good in those."

### Managing Expectations

"But don't expect there to be a direct like, 'oh, I waited so long, I'm getting in there with Queen Ten suited, and these guys have all their Nine Fives.' If you just flopped a gutshot and it's four-way, don't get married to your gutshot."

## Key Takeaways

### The Hand Strength Principle

"Postflop and preflop your hand changes. You're making a better investment. But once the flop comes, it's a new game and you have to reevaluate."

The key to beating splashy-loose tables is understanding that your edge comes from playing stronger hands more often, not from trying to outplay opponents with marginal holdings. Adjust your ranges based on the degree of looseness, expect to play many multiway pots, and focus on value betting rather than bluffing when you do make strong hands.
