my summary: When on a live table, try to categorize the players (rec/pro (people who try to play sound poker),calling station, nit etc) based on their actions, showdowns etc. It's important in live poker to collect information about everything - I want to know who I'm up against when I'm facing close decisions.

# Live Poker Player Profiling and Information Gathering

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Live Play Analysis

"Hey guys, I feel like for live play a lot of concepts are going to come up and the best way to illustrate them is by actually starting to go through live footage. So this will be sort of an intro to that where we make sure that we have all of the concepts and frameworks and anything that's missing we'll make separate videos on."

"This is a five, six... a nine-handed, I think, live table and we're going to start out by saying that we don't know who anyone is. Let's sit down and start playing. At the beginning you play kind of normal, but very quickly we're going to see some information about the players, so this video is going to be a lot about player profiling and how you can use the information you get from player profiling to make better decisions."

### Using Broad Categories for Profiling

"We're going very, very broad categories and I'm not going to go into the what do people look like, but of course feel free to use that based on your experience and look at just the information that we get from the very first hand."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: Sizing Tells and Player Categories

**Setup:** "So we see there's two hundred and fifty in the pot, it's a fifty-one hundred game with an ante."

- **Preflop:** "Brown Balla, UTG, raises to three hundred. What kind of information do we get from that? You might say 'that's silly. What kind of information do you get?' Well, he didn't limp and he didn't raise to seven hundred. So in my head I'm kind of categorizing him in the realm of a pro. I don't know, is he a good pro? Is he a bad pro? But he's trying to play correct. He understands a bunch of concepts, right? Once you get the opening size roughly right, you do understand quite a lot."

"UTG plus one has Queen Jack offsuit, which is a fold."

"Big blind, Alex, calls with Ten Eight offsuit, which is almost certainly too loose. And this is one of the nuanced things in poker, where had it been a min raise, this would be good. Had it been a 4x, this would be terrible. When it's a 3x, it's slightly too loose."

- **Flop (Kh 7d 9c):** "Check. What does a guy with Ace Queen do? He bets three hundred into seven fifty. Again, information going into your head should be, 'hmm, he bet roughly third pot', right? Two hundred and fifty would maybe have been third pot, whatever, like live players, it depends what chips you have and stuff. He bet roughly third pot. So we have kind of two extra pieces of information. They both point towards this guy being a reasonable pro."

"Also we see that he employed a small bet strategy, so we think that he probably bet almost everything in his range on King Seven Nine, so we wouldn't be surprised to see pocket Fives or Ace Queen, Ace Ten, Ten Nine, pocket Tens, whatever. Anything that he open could bet for this size. Ten Eight calls."

- **Turn (Js):** "He checks. Ten Eight here, of course could call or raise, they're both fine. You guys see Brown Balla bet fifteen hundred into a pot of thirteen fifty. Again, if we think about the sizings, the sizings are kind of telling us some sort of a pro. This is a tiny bit bigger than a pot-size bet. That's actually a very appropriate sizing for this board texture."

"Generally speaking, when draws come in, depending on the draw, you want to, after a small bet, size up very big on bricks, but cards that bring both players new types of nuts you have to size down. And depending on which one, not a huge overbet, something between a half pot and pot is fine."

### Advanced Hand Reading Concept

"Ten Eight should probably call here. Just to kind of walk you guys through this. It's the second-nut straight, that's a fairly big deal, but depends on the positions. Maybe I'll throw in some hand reading advice. Had Brown Balla raised from the button, he would have every combination of Queen Ten offsuit for sixteen better straights. But when he raises from under the gun, he shouldn't have Queen Ten offsuit."

"And of course, we have a bunch of things telling us he's a reasonable player and so he might have only Queen Ten suited for four combinations. And then Ten Eight might actually become good enough to raise. So just an example of a more advanced thought process that you can have that tells you, 'how strong is my Ten Eight? Am I behind sixteen combinations or only four?'"

### The Geometric Sizing Tell

"Here we see Ten Eight make a very small raise. Again, this is really important to pick up on this information. So, fifteen hundred. Raised to only four thousand with twenty thousand behind. The way the spot should work is that you're raising bigger."

"And the concept here, I'm not sure if we covered in a previous video or not, but the concept is geometric bet sizing. So when you raise a big bet, you're telling a story of you have something very nutted, like a straight here, and a straight wants to get all the chips in over two streets, so the raise size should be bigger."

"So, Alex made kind of a sloppy raise size and it's sloppy in the eyes of a professional like me. But the main thing is, in terms of the categorization, all I need to do is see the sizing of... this guy's raising some weird smallish size with a lot behind that feels like he should be raising bigger. I don't think he's strong or weak, I just he's more likely less studied in poker, right? More likely a recreational due only to the size."

"And Brown Balla lays it down. Of course, in a hand like this, you wouldn't have known the cards these guys have, but just the information from the sizing, you should have one of them, Brown Balla, tagged as likely professional and given the speed with which he folded to the raise, an aggressive professional because he was obviously bluffing given he folded so quickly. And his opponent is likely a recreational and likely had it."

### Hand 2: Limping and Value Betting Tells

- **Preflop:** "Second hand. Taras limps from early position. Big sign of a recreational player when he limps. Boots raises to 5x. Fairly reasonable sign of a pro, but we're not sure. Pros are going to raise four to 5x in position a lot. Whereas recreationals are more likely to limp behind."

"So, at this stage I would think, Taras limp-called, he's likely a recreational and maybe a passive guy or at least in a passive mood. Of course, I'm not sure. But just walking you guys through my thought process."

- **Flop (4c 2d Qd):** "He checks. Boots checks back."
    
- **Turn (7h):** "Taras checks again. Again, remember we're not going to know their cards in real life. Here Boots fires roughly half-pot bet. All of the sizings kind of tell you suddenly maybe Boots isn't a pro in the sense of studied pros, they often have a third pot, an eighty percent pot. The sizes are more standardized, they wing it less."
    

"Seven hundred into twelve hundred isn't one of them. Here we'd expect Taras to call. And note that he's taking his time and making a face. You'll see later what does that mean about his hand strength."

- **River (Ks):** "Right, river King. Taras checks. Boots should probably bet. This is just basic hand reading. Taras is very unlikely to have improved to a King. So Queen Ten is likely still the best hand."

**Showdown:** Taras shows Ac7c, Boots shows QhTh

"We're going to see a showdown, which is great. And we kind of see that Boots missed a thin value bet. He checked back the flop, he went half pot on the turn. I want you guys to be storing all of this information in your head."

### Reading Conservative Players

"And what does it mean that Boots missed a thin value bet? What type of player misses a thin value bet? It's a more conservative player. It's a guy who, let's say he's trying to hit really strong hands and put money on them. He's not looking to squeeze every edge. So he's less likely to bluff you. He's less likely to be aggressive."

## Key Takeaways

### Information Gathering Process

"Again, this is just me drawing the picture. Of course I have a lot of experience, but I want to show you guys how the wheels in my head would work. And I keep every hand that unfolds, I'm putting these players into buckets of who's a pro, who's a recreational, what information do I have about them? So I'm collecting more and more information."

### The Live Poker Advantage

"And one of the beautiful things about live poker is you're only playing at one table. Everything's very slow. As long as you're not on the phone, your brain can collect all of this information and all of it is very useful later."

"So, really, live poker starts with collecting information about absolutely everything because close decisions are going to come up later on and you really want to know who you're up against when you play them. And you're definitely not up against someone who plays like a computer."

### Quick Profiling Indicators

**Pro Indicators:**

- Correct opening sizes (3x from UTG)
- Small c-bet sizing (1/3 pot) on dry boards
- Appropriate turn sizing adjustments
- Quick folds when bluff-catching spots arise

**Recreational Indicators:**

- Limping from early position
- Non-geometric raise sizes with nuts
- Non-standard bet sizing (half pot instead of standard sizes)
- Missing thin value bets

**Conservative Player Indicators:**

- Checking back marginal hands
- Missing thin value opportunities
- Less likely to bluff or be aggressive
