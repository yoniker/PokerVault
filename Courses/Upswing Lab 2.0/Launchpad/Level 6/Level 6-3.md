My summary:
In online settings I almost always want to iso since mostly all of the other players will fold and I will play heads-up vs a weaker player. In live it's a full ring table and on a loose table the entire table might come - so i want to adjust based on table type and limper type: If table is tight - iso wider and pound on him, if table is loose then treat the limp as if it's a "raise to one big blind"- i can overlimp and i can 3-bet.

# Limping Strategy - Live vs Online Games

## Core Concepts

### The Complexity of Live Game Limping

"Hey guys, I'm going to try to make this short and concise. It's important to recognize that limping in live games is a complicated subject because the environment you're playing in can vary quite a lot."

### Online Game Dynamics

"In online games, people who limp tend to have a wide range, passive temperament, and they're kind of curious to see a flop, so what is recommended in online games is to isolate fairly frequently and wide."

"So, after the limper, you play your continuing range as a raise, most of the rest of the table tends to get out of the way because online players know their preflop charts, basically. And then you're very often heads up with a weak player and he's going to check and fit or fold a flop and overfold."

"This is the classic situation of limping and it's why you might feel the need to isolate limpers a lot."

### Why Live Games Are Different

"But in live scenarios, the setting is often very different. One thing that's very different is you're often at a full-ring table and the whole table is playing very loose. And just because one guy limp, you're not in a vacuum. You still have the whole rest of the table to worry about and it doesn't really work out well for you to isolate with a weak speculative holding because of the rest of the table."

### The Pocket Fives Example

"This is so important and so prevalent in live games where someone's going to limp and you have Fives and, should you isolate Fives? The answer is, not necessarily. It's just like you wouldn't necessarily raise Fives big. Just because this guy isn't, that doesn't push you towards raising Fives big. You kind of rather limp behind."

## Strategic Adjustments

### The Importance of Limping Behind

"I feel like it's very important to have the option to limp behind and to recognize the table."

### Table-Dependent Strategy

"If it's a tightish table and the limper's weak passive, isolate him very wide and pound on him. If it's a loose table or if the limper is maybe a bit tighter or he plays back at your whatever, I would treat the limp as though it's a raise to one big blind, with whatever range he's playing, and then I'd play calls and three bets basically."

### Range Construction Against Limpers

"So I wouldn't call super wide, but I wouldn't three bet super weak either."

## Key Takeaways

Live game limping strategy requires careful table assessment rather than automatic isolation. The presence of loose players behind you and full-ring dynamics make limping behind a valuable option that shouldn't be overlooked. Treat limps differently based on table dynamics - aggressive isolation against weak passive players at tight tables, but more conservative approaches at loose tables where you're not playing in a vacuum.
