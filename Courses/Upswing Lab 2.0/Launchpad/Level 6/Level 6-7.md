My summary: vs nit/passive players, steal the blinds a lot and steal the pot postflop a lot. If they suddenly wake up and put a lot of money, just fold.
# Playing at Very Passive-Nitty Tables

## Core Concepts

### The Passive-Nitty Environment

"How to play at very passive-nitty tables. This is going to be the counterpart to how to play at splashy-loose tables. Very passive-nitty tables what's going to happen, generally, is you're going to steal the blinds a lot, you're going to get three bet very rarely... And let's assume that the same goes for postflop, they're going to check a lot to you and fold a lot to you, et cetera, right?"

### The Surface-Level Benefits

"On the surface sounds amazing. You can widen your opening ranges. Maybe you can even widen your three betting ranges, depending on, do they open nit? Or do they react to a three bet nit? Of course, if someone rarely opens, don't re-raise them. But if they open kind of normal, but they just get scared when you re-raise, you can do that."

### Why the Obvious Approach Isn't Enough

"So there's a lot of good stuff going on, but on its own, it's not good enough."

## Strategic Adjustments

### The Critical Key to Success

"The very, very important key to winning at the passive-nitty tables is, when these guys suddenly wake up and they raise you or they bet big or whatever, you believe them and you fold. That's so, so important."

### The Danger of Overthinking

"All of the tiny pots you win aren't going to help you if when the pot gets big, suddenly you're thinking, 'oh, maybe he's bluffing. How could he have it? Can you make a call for a stack with a backdoor there?'"

## Hand Examples

### The Pocket Nines Example

- **Flop (4c 4s 6h):** "Good example would be, let's say board is 4c 4s 6h. You have pocket Nines. You c-bet, the guy raises, you, call."
- **Turn (any card):** "Turn comes any card, he fires a big bet, you just fold."

### The Mindset Adjustment

"Don't even bother with it. Don't try thinking, 'where am I in my ranges?' I mean, these guys are not bluffing. That's the whole reason we're saying passive and nitty. So he has trips way more often than he should."

## Key Takeaways

### Understanding the Profit Source

"And the way you make money, you're making money all the time by him folding and giving up and not bluffing. So when suddenly money goes in, he probably just has it to often."

The key to beating passive-nitty tables is exploiting their passivity by widening ranges and stealing frequently, but crucially believing them when they suddenly show aggression. Your profit comes from the many small pots they give up, not from trying to call them down in big pots when they finally decide to bet or raise.
