My summary:
MW pots the responsibility to defend is all of the other players in the pot, so it's supposed to be player super tight. If there are 5 players in the pot I will win about 20% of the time and that's ok if I lose most of the time. Also, people don't do as much folding as theory dictates, so don't bluff a lot MW.

# Multiway Pots in Soft Games - Strategy Guide

## Core Concepts

### How Multiway Differs from Heads-Up

"Okay, so let's start with how to play multiway pots and soft games. You guys will recall that I discussed how in poker, every hand has a sweet spot that it's aiming for. As your opponent puts in money, say you have a hundred combinations in your range, if he makes a pot-size bet, you fold half, he makes another pot-size bet, you fold another half, he makes another pot-size bet, you fold another half and by the river you're left with twelve and a half combos. Very roughly speaking, but this is the big picture idea."

"Well, what happens in multiway pots is very, very different. In multiway pots, say we are five people and we each have a hundred combinations in our range, and someone makes a pot-size bet. The other four people together are supposed to continue fifty combos. So things get tight really, really fast, but they're also not supposed to continue it in the same way."

### Range Tightening in Multiway Action

"So the first guy still has three people behind him, so he needs to continue less than a quarter of fifty combos. So just to this first bet less than twelve and a half combos."

## Hand Examples

### The Ace Nine Example

"Now, a good illustration of this would be, let's say the board is Ac 7s 3h. We're five-handed to the flop. Someone makes a pot-size bet. You're next to act with Ace Nine, what should you do? And the answer is fold."

"This is very surprising to a lot of people because they're used to 'pot-size bet, continue half my range'. This is way higher than half my range. This is maybe in the top twenty percent of my range, so of course I continue it. But no, you're actually supposed to continue roughly top ten percent. Ace Nine doesn't cut it. You'd need maybe Ace Nine with a backdoor flush draw, something fairly strong. This is kind of how multiway pots work."

### Later Position Adjustments

"Further down the line, the last guy continues more than twelve and a half, but he's also continuing kind of tight. So definitely not calling with a Seven Eight suited or something."

## Strategic Adjustments for Soft Games

### Why Standard Theory Doesn't Apply

"You guys hopefully can see how the pot-size bet in the first place narrows the ranges so much that you can hardly ever make it. What ends up happening in practice in soft games is that people don't realize these differences, so they play multiway pots a lot more similar in terms of how big and which hands they bet and which hands they call, as though it were just two people in the hand."

### Bluffing Doesn't Work

"This kind of creates a situation where in order to beat soft games multiway pots, generally bluffing doesn't work very well because people are not doing the dance of folding enough of their range to your bets. They actually fold too little, so bluffing does not work very well in multiway pots. That's one side of it."

### Fold More Than Your Intuition Says

"And the other side is you want to fold quite a lot, probably a lot more than your intuition. Even if these guys are opening looser than they should be, still fold more than your intuition. There are still people behind, it's still a big bet."

### Finding the Middle Ground

"You guys can pick an in-between stage because people are overplaying their range. You don't have to fold Ace Jack to the pot-size bet with three people behind, even though in theory you probably should, but yeah, definitely don't call with Ace five or something."

"Again, poker is a game of trading mistakes. If they're making loose calls and you aren't, in the long run, you're making money against them here, right? By not bluffing, making better folds and better calls."

### Value Betting is King

"And when you have a good hand just bet it and enjoy the free money, right? Because the counterside to 'bluffing doesn't work' is that betting for value works great."

## Psychological Aspects

### Understanding Win Rates in Multiway Pots

"And I guess something I'll add is in a lot of these games you will very often have four or five, six people seeing the flop and you might feel like you keep losing and losing and losing and you never win. And the time you make a hand, everyone folds. This is a feeling you'll sometimes get in these games."

"And what I think is very important to understand is that when there are five people seeing the flop, all other things being equal, you're supposed to win one in five hands. So you're supposed to lose most of the hands and all you need is to go on a slightly unlucky run and it's one in ten hands, which might mean losing seven hands in a row when you see the flop multiway. And this is just the way it works. Your brain needs to get used to it."

### The Mental Game

"And the idea is you lose less the times you're behind, you win more of the times, you're ahead, but you're not supposed to win a lot of those multiway pots. So if a lot of people are seeing the flop, be very, very ready to just do a lot of folding and a lot of checking. There's no need to be super out of line without a very good reason and don't worry about it."

### Common Misconceptions About Heads-Up vs Multiway

"I often hear a lot of people say that they prefer to play heads-up pots because in heads-up pots they feel like they can outplay the other player, whereas if multiway, they're more handcuffed in what they can do and they don't feel like they're doing too well. And I think this is a common misconception, because in a heads-up pot all you're supposed to win roughly half the time. And so you end up winning a lot and you get a lot of opportunities to increase that half of the time to some bigger number."

"But when it's, say five-way to the flop, you're actually only supposed to win one in five times. So most of the time you are actually supposed to lose."

### The Reality of Variance

"And you might get this weird feeling multiway where you fold, or you call a bet and you fold a turn, or you check down and lose, and you have these hands a few in a row and every time other guys are giving action. But really in a five-way pot, there's only going to be one winner every time and there are going to be four guys who hand that pot the money. So the nature of randomness and variance would mean it's very easy to lose ten of these in a row."

"And you might think everything's wrong and you hate multiway pots and you don't know how to win, but really you just need to be patient and play good spots when they come up."

## Key Takeaways

### Small Edges Matter More

"And there are good spots multiway. So if in a five-way pot we're supposed to win twenty percent of the time, increasing that to twenty-two percent of the time is actually a ten percent increase in your win rate. So you don't have to find as many spots as you do in the heads-up pot and just kind of get used to the fact that you're often sitting out and not in the driver's seat on these."

### Mental Recalibration

"Don't force the action. Don't feel like you're doing anything wrong. You need to recalibrate your brain to be willing to just lose and give up quite a lot in these."
