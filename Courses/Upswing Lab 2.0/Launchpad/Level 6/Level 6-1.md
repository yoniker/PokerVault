My summary: To maximize my profits in soft games I need to do something about it, if I keep playing "proper strategy" I will not maximize my profits (think of a basketball game where an opponent fks around and goes with the ball to his side of the court, if I won't actively do something about it I won't maximize my score from his mistakes)

# Playing Soft Games - Exploitative Play Introduction

## Core Concepts

### The Nature of Exploitative Play

"This video is going to be about playing soft games, also known as the Dance of Poker and also known as Exploitative Play."

"The first thing I would like to mention in this context is that poker as a game is very different from other types of games. In most games, when your opponent makes a mistake, the benefits for you are very immediate and very easy to realize, and poker doesn't actually work in that way."

### Why Opponent Mistakes Don't Automatically Help

"Let's say your opponent raises with too tight of a range, that doesn't actually help you in any immediate way. If he raises too loose of a range, it doesn't help you in any immediate way. The benefits to you will be very marginal unless you actually do something about it."

"Poker is a game with a lot of invisible information."

### The Basketball Analogy

"Let's compare poker to basketball, where basketball, all of the information is visible. Let's say we're playing basketball and a player on the other team just throws the ball up into the air and catches it, and throws it up into the air and catches it. And then he starts going in the wrong direction. He's going in the direction of his basket."

"Clearly, all of the stuff he's doing is beneficial to you, and because you see it, you can react to it. You can get closer to him. You can try to catch the ball when it's in the air, right? You can do all these things."

"But if you just stay in your regular defensive place as he is doing all these shenanigans, doesn't really help you, right? Unless professional game shot, walk, whatever. But let's say it's a fun basketball game without those rules. He's just fucking around. You don't gain any real benefit unless you actually move to him and try to take the ball."

### Poker's Unique Challenges

"Poker is kind of similar to this in that a lot of mistakes that people make are not going to give you any immediate benefit unless you do something about it. And the added issue is, the information is invisible. It's not on a basketball court. And interpreting the information is a lot tougher and requires a lot more skill."

### The Problem with Playing "Proper Poker" Only

"So when we play in really soft games, if we were to stick to playing just proper poker, just play our ranges, play our sizings, which are things you're going to learn how to do better and better as you progress through the material, you're not reaping near the full benefit of what you could be."

### The Core Principle of Poker

"Really, poker is a game where, as most games, you just need to be better than the other guys. You don't need to be perfect but to be better than the other guys. That does mean recognize what they're doing and do something about it."

## Key Takeaways

### Series Overview

"That's basically what this series of videos is going to be about. We're going to talk about several types of mistakes that people can make, how to identify them, whether you can do anything about them, when, because sometimes in poker what you do happens in the future rather than in the present."

### Scope and Depth

"It's not going to be super in depth. We're going to cover this stuff more and more in the future, but the very basics of mistake, how to identify it, what's a proper adjustment... We'll go through a few of the common ones in this chapter."
