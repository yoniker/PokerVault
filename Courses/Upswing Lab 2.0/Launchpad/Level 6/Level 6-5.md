# Reacting to Oversized Raises and Three-Bets

## Core Concepts

### Understanding Non-Standard Sizing

"Next in line, how to react to huge raises in three bets, or how to react to small raises in three bets. In poker, we have the, let's say, 'standard sizes', which you guys will learn of how big do I three bet, how big do I four bet? How big do I open-raise? But lot of people do it differently."

### The Strategic Impact of Different Sizing

"And the answer is, doing it differently doesn't directly hurt them in a big way, but it does force you to react differently. So it's kind of doing it differently is suboptimal if you react optimally. Those two go together. If you react badly, it's not even suboptimal."

### The Primary Adjustment to Oversized Raises

"So if someone makes raises that are way too big, generally speaking, you just need to fold more. Here we're talking about three bets that are way too big, but also raises that are way too big. So generally speaking, you just need to fold more. We'll show you guys how much more and what difference it makes, but there's not a lot more than that to it, right?"

### Why Oversizing is Bad for the Aggressor

"Why is it bad for him? Well, it's bad for him the times you have a good hand, he put more dead money on the pot. He kind of put in too much money with too loose of a range. That doesn't work out great for him. I will show you guys that down the line how much money that loses him."

### When the Oversizing Actually Works

"But it doesn't work out great when you have a good hand, not when you have a bad or a medium hand. When you have a medium hand, actually works out great. By raising big, he's risking too much. There are too many people left to act. They're going to wake up with a good hand too often and punish him. But the punishment only happens with a good hand. The rest of the time it works out fine."

## Strategic Adjustments

### The Folding Response

"So yeah, just fold more. If someone three bets very big or raises very big, suddenly maybe you can't call with Deuces, maybe you can't call with Five Six suited. So you need to start folding those hands."

### The Core Principle

"And the main adjustment, again, I'll show you guys where the line lies and it's not like you have to fold everything, but is just recognizing that we need to make less money with our medium hands and more money with our good hands."

## Key Takeaways

When facing oversized raises or three-bets, the primary adjustment is to fold more, particularly with medium-strength and speculative hands. The oversizing strategy only gets punished when you have strong hands, so you need to be more selective about continuing with marginal holdings while ensuring you extract maximum value when you do have premium hands.
