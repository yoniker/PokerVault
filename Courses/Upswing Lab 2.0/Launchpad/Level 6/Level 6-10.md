My summary: If I'm known to be a nit who never bluffs and I'm known to never bluff, then I will make a lot of money bluffing a lot.  In general people tend to overfold in poker so bluffs work well. Master my courage and bluff!! Especially in spots where people showed weakness/good board for my range. It's important to bluff sometimes so people will pay me off. I don't need to be perfectly balanced - just to put a doubt in their head as to whether I'm bluffing or not.

# The Importance of Bluffing and Balance in Poker

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Balance and Theory

"This is kind of a meta game video, like an abstract video about the importance of bluffing and balance. I want to kind of paint the picture of how poker works and where balance and where theory come from."

### The Reputation Effect

"And I was asked recently, 'is bluffing important?' What tends to happen is, if you never bluff, at some point you get a reputation as a nit and people stop paying you off. If you're very tight preflop, you get a reputation as a nit and people start folding. And if you always fold to three bets, people start three-bet bluffing. All of these kinds of things happen. You're really not playing in a vacuum in poker, that's very important to understand."

### The Self-Balancing Nature of Poker

"What ends up happening very often is that things tend to balance out in the sense that if you never, ever bluff and people have noticed that about you, then whenever you run a bluff, it's going to make you so much money because everyone's just going to believe you."

### Real-World Example: Three-Bet Dynamics

"There was a guy I coached years and years ago who would fold way too much to three bets. Online we have stats on people, so everyone could see this guy was doing this and everyone was going after him. And of course he didn't realize he was folding too much, he just thought he's playing normal."

"But once I pointed it out to him, the dynamic of the situation was that people were three betting him with junky stuff and then giving up. All he needed to do to make money was to call three bets. His hand almost didn't matter. The same goes on in a lot of different situations."

### The Theoretical vs Practical Importance of Bluffing

"So, the answer to the question 'is bluffing important?' would be, theoretically it's not very important, but if you don't do it, people will notice and then it becomes important. So the answer is kind of, yes, bluffing is important, playing loose enough is important, and playing not too loose is important and not bluffing too much are important."

### Finding the Right Range

"So you want to get into kind of a reasonable range of doing things. For a lot of experienced players this comes naturally, where people are not really sure are you bluffing too much or are you bluffing too little? So you don't have to get it accurate, but you want people to have that question in their head."

### Starting to Bluff

"And then you can start picking your spots and picking your opponents, et cetera. But if you're a guy who never bluffs, the first thing you need to understand is bluffing is going to make you so much money in the beginning, whether it's online or live. Just close your eyes, muster the courage and do it."

### General Population Tendencies

"And generally speaking, from a data standpoint, players in poker tend to fold too much. So bluffing is, even though theoretically it shouldn't make you much money, practically speaking, it should."

### When to Bluff

"The recommendation I would have for you guys is generally to think about the good-board, bad-board, good-card, bad-card stuff. Whenever it's a good board, you should probably bluff. Whenever it's a good runout, you should probably bluff. And whenever someone splits their range, some kind of, he could have bet, but he checked... reasonable spot to bluff."

### Adjusting to Opponents

"All of these spots you should be aggressively going after and just kind of see what happens. If people start calling you really wide, against those guys, you slow down. If people keep folding, good, keep doing it."

### Why Aggression Works

"But generally aggression in poker works. Just the nature of how people react to the game. Against the computer it wouldn't. That's why bluffing is kind of you can do it or not do it, but in practice it tends to work quite well. So, definitely important to bluff in general in poker."
