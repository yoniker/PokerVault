# Hand Metrics for Various Boards

## Core Concepts

### Playing from Position

"So we're gonna go through the hand metrics for several different boards and explain roughly what we want to be doing with each hand as the in position preflop raiser."

"This is currently the offensive part of poker and we're gonna start out by discussing the offensive part of poker. It's the easier one to play, it's the one you should be playing more often."

"What characterizes the fact that you are on the offensive is that you have the stronger preflop range, you have the initiative and usually you have position. So you get to determine the action."

"All of these situations are where we're in position, we raised and the big blind called and as these dynamics shift strategies will shift and we will discuss that. But this is kind of the very, very basic, how do you play as in position preflop raiser."

## Board Analysis: Ace Seven Deuce Rainbow

"Board number one is Ace Seven Deuce rainbow. I think we already covered that."

## Board Analysis: Ten Nine Eight Two Tone

### Understanding Relative Hand Strength

"Board number two, we're gonna look at 10, 9, 8, two tone. So very, very different board."

"So a hand like Deuces when it comes 10, 9, 8, three over cards, you're not going to win at showdown very often. And it's important to realize that a pair is not very strong when there are three cards above it, but not just three cards. Three high cards."

"So if the board comes 7, 6, 5, Deuces is a lot more valuable than on 10, 9, 8 because preflop ranges tend to be weighted high."

### Playing Small Pairs

"So here any under pair - Deuces, Threes, Fours, Fives, and to some extent Sixes and Sevens, although these are a bit stronger, is generally hoping to check down. That's the best scenario for your hand."

"For right now, we're gonna keep it simple. And I'm just gonna describe the best scenario. You could always throw in a small bet with these types of hands, but generally speaking, at this board, you check down and hope your opponent shows you ace high. And most of the time you're gonna lose to ace high, similar but worse."

### Playing Missed Hands

"So if we miss with something like Ace Two, we either bluff or we give up, we're not very likely to show down and win. Given the board is this high and connected."

"Again, on a board like 7, 6, 5, ace high can show down and win, but this board is much tougher."

### Bluffing on Connected Boards

"So your ace highs and your king highs, weak pair hands, you could bluff with them. But generally speaking, the recommendation I'm gonna have for you guys to start is to on these very connected boards, to try bluffing mostly when you have something that interacts with the board."

"So here that would be a Queen, a Jack, a Seven or a Six, all of which would make for gutshots. And if not those a flush draw or at least a high flush card."

"So if there are two spades, maybe Ace of Spades King, so something that interacts with this board, those hands make your better bluffs. And the rest we'd mostly give up."

### The Give Up Option

"Usually when I say give up, what I mean is don't bet on the flop. Generally speaking, if your opponent checks to you two times or three times then you're free to take a stab with almost any hand you have since most players are too weak in those situations."

### Playing Middle Pairs

"Next hand category would be a pair of Eights, a pair of Nines or a pair of Tens. So one pair when the cards are disconnected, Eight, Nine, and Ten have similar value."

"All of these hands are looking at something between a small and a medium sized bet and then trying to show it down."

"Generally speaking, with an Eight, you check, maybe call one bet. With a Nine, you'd either check or bet small. With a Ten you could check or bet medium and not really look to put in multiple bets."

### Playing Top Pair

"With a hand like Ace Ten, we'd kind of like to put in one bet and check it down because what happens on Ten Nine Eight is that half of the time or more it's going to come a runout where your hand gets devalued."

"So if you look at something like Ace Ten, think of how many cards are bad for you. So there is a Six, a Seven, a Jack, a Queen, and a King and say a Spade if it's two spades. So that's I think roughly half the deck already. We're not even talking about an Eight or a Nine."

"So it just more often than not comes out a bad runout for you. And so what I would say is on the flop we'd be looking to put roughly one bet in, but as the board develops, that might change."

### Runout Dependency

"So if it's 10, 9, 8, you bet your Ace Ten and the turn comes a Deuce and the river comes a Three, of course your hand is now worth another bet. So it's a bit runout dependent, but we're very, very cautious with these hands and we don't value them too much."

"Actually on a board like 10, 9, 8, something like Jack Ten, which is a Ten, but also an open-ended straight draw is a much better hand because there are a lot less bad runouts and a lot more good runouts. So even though you have lower absolute hand strength, that is a stronger hand."

### Playing Overpairs

"What about overpairs? Jacks through Aces? So similar to Ace Ten, these are hands where they want between one to two bets in depending on the runout."

"You could easily check back a hand like Aces or Kings here, see the turn card and then decide how much money you're putting in. You could also bet once and then see the turn card."

"But just be very aware that when the board is 10, 9, 8 and there are so many two pairs and straights and flushes possible that a hand like an overpair is much weaker than you're used to. It being much weaker than on something like Ace Seven Deuce."

### Playing Draws

"The next hand class I guess would be draws. I'd say with an eight outer or better draw you can bluff twice as a default. That's not theory. Theory is very deceptive. And as we're gonna get more advanced, I'll teach you guys how to do that."

"But as a starting point to develop an aggressive strategy, I think the idea is that when you have a good bluffing candidate, you bet and the scenarios are either you pick up the pot or your opponent calls and you improve or your opponent calls and you don't improve. And at least two of three of those are good and usually that makes for enough to make it a good bet."

### Playing Strong Made Hands

"Next hand category, say we have something like two pair, three of a kind or a straight, those would be like the really strong hands. With two pair on 10, 9, 8, we're in a similar type of situation to if we had Aces or Ace Ten where even though the hand is stronger, half of the runouts are gonna devalue it a lot."

"I want to go through this because a lot of players misunderstand this. So say you have Eight Nine on 10, 9, 8, if the turn is a Six, Seven, Jack, Queen, or Spade, our hand is suddenly only worth one bet if that, right?"

### Counting Bad Cards

"The way I count this, there are nine spades in addition to the board. That's generally just a rule of thumb. And then because some of these cards, each of one of these would've been a spade, we'll actually count, say two Tens and three of each of the other ones."

"So we'll say that that is nine flush cards, 14 other cards. So 23 turn cards where you're gonna kind of regret that you bet the flop."

"Once you realize that it's like this for a hand like Eight Nine, and even somewhat like this for a hand like pocket Eights or pocket Nines, I think you start to evaluate these hands a lot more accurately."

### Two Pair Strategy

"When we have something like two pair on 10, 9, 8, we can bet, but we don't have to bet, it's certainly fine to check back and see a turn."

"If we do bet and we get called, we see a bad turn, we have to reevaluate how much money our hand wants to put in and very quickly step away from the absolute hand strength of two pair or top pair, top kicker."

"Realize that once the board is showing four high cards to a straight or three to a flush, these hand types are very, very devalued."

## Key Takeaways

### Context Is Everything

"This is a mistake a lot of players make in the beginning where you know it takes a long time to make two pair or to make a set. So when we get these hands, we have the feeling that we should be winning a big pot."

"But everything in poker as in life, is very, very context dependent. And so you have to evaluate your hand strength with the context of the board."

### Not All Strong Hands Are Equal

"Not all two pairs are created equal. You have two pair on Ace Seven Deuce, that's great. You're gonna win a big pot. Probably you have two pair on 10, 9, 8, 7. That's not a very strong hand. You mostly hope it checks down. If you face a big bet, you just hope your opponent's bluffing. So it's a very, very different hand type and that's very important to realize."
