# Bluff-Catching Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Introduction

"Hey guys! An attempt to explain how bluff-catching works in a simple way as possible."

"So what I mean by bluff-catching is how you respond to your opponent's bets specifically when you have something that's not very, very clear cut."

### Combinatorics and Range Narrowing

"And the concept that I want you guys to have in your mind is a combinatorics concept of not just your exact hand, but all of the hands you can have in the situation, so, your range, and how your range gets narrowed as more money goes in."

### Theoretical Example of Range Narrowing

"We'll start with a theoretical example. Let's say our range is one hundred combinations going to the flop. Our opponent bets twenty-five percent pot, so, tiny. We would narrow our range to eighty combinations, so we would fold the bottom twenty percent of hands."

"If our opponent would bet, say, pot, if our opponent bets bigger, we narrow our range to fifty combinations."

"Now, another example. If our opponent bets twenty-five percent into four people and each of the four people have a hundred combinations, in a way we would actually narrow our range a lot more, and this would be more like narrow our range to fifty combinations."

"I'm not being accurate with the numbers, I just want to convey the concept."

### Progressive Range Narrowing

"But as our opponent keeps betting, our range is going to narrow and narrow. So, if our opponent makes another pot size bet, narrow to twenty-five, and if another one, narrow to twelve and a half, right? So our range gets narrower and narrower the more money goes in."

## Common Mistakes

### Two Types of Errors

"And this is a very deceptive thing for people on both ends of the spectrum. The types of mistakes you might be making are, first of all, if your opponent bets tiny, you might be narrowing your range too much."

"For example, he bets really small and you fold, like we said, too many combinations. In order to call enough combinations, you need to widen your perception of what's a playable hand to include what we call backdoor draws, overcards, overcards to the middle cards sometimes, it depends on how wide ranges are, but you need to continue quite wide because against the small bet you don't need to win very often."

### The Counter Mistake

"And the counter mistake would be that often when people flop something like top pair or they have an overpair, they think, wow, this is really high up in my range. It's a high combination, so they don't fold it even when actually too much money went in."

"Maybe your opponent made two pot-sized bets against four players and suddenly your range is supposed to be so narrow that your top pair actually gets folded, but you don't realized how narrowing the action made your range."

### Playing Defense

"Playing defense has a lot to do with understanding these concepts."

"And I'm going to run you guys through a few simple examples of how our range gets narrower as we face multiple bets. And through these examples, I want you guys to kind of see and start being able to visualize how to play top pair, how to play middle pair, how to play some random gutshot."

"At what point did the bets your opponent make make your hand foldable? And at what point did it make it very, very clearly foldable?"

## Hand Example: A♥7♠2♣

### Setup

"Okay guys, I want to quickly walk you guys through a few examples of how calling ranges narrow with different sized bets."

"We'll load up Lucid, we're going to be a hundred deep. Remember this is just the basic basic examples. We're going to go button versus big blind."

### Opening Ranges

"This would be a button opening range. So offsuit hands, Nine and higher, offsuit Aces, pocket pairs and a bunch of suited stuff."

"In the big blind defending range, he re-raises the top of his range here. There are some mixed bluffs everywhere else. Again, nice suited stuff, Nine offsuit and higher and offsuit Aces. And this has to do with the sizing, just like every spot in poker. But yet not getting into that too much."

### Flop Play (A♥7♠2♣)

"So let's start with a very disconnected board. We'll start with Ace Seven Deuce rainbow. I want to show you guys, and we'll kind of track as money goes in, which of our hands are in I-just-have-to-call mode versus when do we get to a point where we ask ourselves the question, is he bluffing or not? And we actually don't have to call."

"So we start out with a check. And here our opponent can fire three different bet sizes and we have a different response against each."

"If he goes for a small thirty percent sized bet, we're going to have to defend everything."

"So you might fold a Seven to one big bet. But yeah, let's kind of go forward."

### Turn Play (A♥7♠2♣ 6♠)

"So, our opponent bet small, we call. Say the turn is a Six, so nothing special happened. We check, and here our opponent fires an eighty-percent-pot size bet."

"And we ask ourselves, well remember thirty and then eighty. That's similar to the big bet from before. So our top pairs are kind of forced to call. When we have a pair of Sevens it's a are-you-bluffing-or-not decision. And when we have a pocket pair, the theoretical answer would be to just fold."

### Board Pairs vs Pocket Pairs

"And the reason is that a pair of Sevens does better. A board pair does better than something like a pair of Eights or a pair of Fives when your opponent's betting big because it's easier to improve."

"Nine Seven suited improves to trips on a Seven or to two pair on a Nine. That's five outs to improve. Whereas something like Eights only improves on an Eight. Only two outs to improve. So we tend to prefer, I say 'tend' because there are exceptions, we tend to prefer the board pairs."

### Computer's Defense Strategy

"What you see here is the computer saying, 'I have a bunch of different hands to defend. I'm always calling my Aces. And then, when I look at the rest of my hands, of course I'm going to fold my King Jack high. I'd rather have a pair of Sevens than a pocket pair, so I'll fold the pocket pair and my pair of Sevens will mix. It'll be the indifferent hand'."

### Practical Approach

"This is what the computer is saying. But in practice for you, from your perspective, you could treat this spot a bit simpler and say, 'well, a pair of Aces has to call and everything else that beats a bluff can play call or fold'. And it's not a big deal which one you choose, right?"

"So, maybe you call twice with a pair of Eights or a pair of Fives. That wouldn't be a big disaster. It would be a slight theoretical mistake if your opponent were very balanced."

"But the main thing is that we realize our hand is now a bluff-catcher. We're no longer forced to call and we now have a decision. That's the key point, to understand when your hand goes from 'they have to call', so Fives on the flop has to call a small bet, to 'I have a decision'."

"Then you can look at your opponent or you can look at is it a good bluff-catcher or a bad bluff-catcher, like we said, Ace Seven is better than pocket Eights. Pocket Eights is better than King Jack high, et cetera."

### River Play (A♥7♠2♣ 6♠ J♥)

"Now, say we call and the river comes a Jack, and this is where a lot of beginners might make a mistake."

"We check and our opponent fires the big river bet here. It's going to be a small overbet. We're like, 'well, which hands are going to have to call here?' And pause and ask yourselves, 'which hands do I have to call? And which hands have a bluff-catching decision?'"

"The answer is going to be, you kind of have to call when you have two pair, but the rest of your hands have a bluff-catching decision. And even your very weak two pairs like Six Seven and Jack Seven and Jack Deuce might have a bluff-catching decision."

"If you have something like Ace Ten, you can call and try to catch a bluff, but by no means are you obligated to call."

### The Inflection Point

"And this is extremely important to recognize this inflection point of, yes, Ace Ten was a great hand on the flop, but enough money went in, our range got narrow enough, we now only beat the bluff, so we now get to start folding this hand."

"So yeah, I feel like this is a really key point. I hope this illustration is clear."

### General Order of Operations

"You can imagine this for a different board. Usually the order of operations is, facing the first bet... Again, this depends into how many people it is and how big it is, but let's say, generally speaking, most boards facing the first bet, you're going to continue everything that connects to the board and then depending on the size of the bet, some backdoor stuff."

"Against the second bet we narrow to always continuing top pairs and mixing in with the rest of our bluff-catchers."

"And against the third bet, depending on the size, we do start folding some top pairs and mainly continue two pair plus as a pure easy decision where, say you have a Six, you're like, 'okay, I have to call, put the money in. There's nothing to think about.' Because maybe your opponent is betting a worse hand and not bluffing."

"But if you have even something like Ace Queen here, you do have a real decision on your hands."

### Alternative River: A♠ Creates Flush

"So just to maybe drive this point home, let's say that the river is the Ace of spades. What's special about the Ace of spades? An Ace is now trips for us, but the flush came in."

"And if we check the river and our opponent fires a big bet, we're not obligated to call trips by any means, right? Just because it's trips. Because a big bet will be centered around flushes."

"So we are obligated to call flushes. You guys will see that flushes of course, are not folding. Boats are not folding. Some boats are going to be raising."

"But if we have just trips, just because it's trips, there's always a context of the board and you don't have to call."

## Key Takeaways

### When to Make Bluff-Catching Decisions

"And that's... In my eyes, the key to bluff-catching is realizing when is it a bluff-catching decision and when isn't it."

"And when it is, you can start thinking of a host of factors. Who's my opponent? What's the action? Do I think he's bluffing or not? What are the properties of my hand?"

"And you're going to be faced with tough, close decisions, but you want to not be locked into, 'I have to call'."

### Board Context Matters

"And that's very important to understand."
