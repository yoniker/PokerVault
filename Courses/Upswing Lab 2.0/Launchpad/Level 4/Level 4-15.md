# Capped Ranges Concept

## Core Concepts

### Definition of Capped Ranges

"I wanted to discuss the concept of capped ranges. This is a concept that we think about a lot when we're making decisions. So you guys are going to encounter many coaches using this concept."

"So, 'capped' would indicate that the range is a certain strength or less, so it's capped at that strength. And what it means is when a guy's range is capped is that when your hand is over the cap, you can basically put any amount of money that you want into the pot."

### Theoretical Implications

"Imagine hypothetical scenario where I'm the only one who can have the nuts for whatever reason. It's preflop. If it's postflop I could presumably bet a thousand times the pot and have some bluffs thrown in there and that would actually be the optimal size."

"In practice, what tends to happen is that as players get capped, bet sizes increase for the guy who is less capped."

## Hand Examples

### Example 1: Button vs Big Blind on Q♠8♥4♦

"So I'll give you guys one or two examples. This is a Queen Eight Four rainbow board button versus big blind where flop goes check check. I specifically constructed this example for this."

- **Flop (Q♠8♥4♦):** "Check check"
- **Turn (3♠):** "Big blind checks. We overbet with Jack Ten offsuit. He calls. Of course he's not calling any Jack Ten offsuit, right?"
- **River (9♦):** "Then river is a Nine. Now, on the Nine we improved the Jack Ten. The straight. He never has Jack Ten the straight."

"So what we'll see is that the most common used sizing is to just shove for 5x pot and we get to shove with pocket Nines, which is the nuts that we have and he doesn't. Jack Ten, which is the nuts and we have and he doesn't. And some pocket Threes, two pairs."

"Pocket Threes isn't the super nuts and maybe opponent has Fours. And same for Queen Four, maybe he has Queen Nine. But it's the effective nuts. He's capped enough, right? If his range is fifty combinations and one of them beats us then so be it, we treat him as effectively capped."

### Example 2: Exploiting Capped Ranges on A♠7♣2♦

"Now, a way that old school pros used to, me included, used to use this is that when your opponent is capped and you throw out really big sizes, he has to call with bluff-catchers. And that's very uncomfortable for some people. Some people don't really want to put in their stack when they only beat a bluff."

"So I'll show you guys maybe an example of where I used to use this years and years ago. Way before solvers, I really enjoyed doing this, but basically I'd get some Ace Seven Deuce board, button versus big blind. And let's say I ran out like a Queen Four."

"Basically what I'd do is, I'd be like, people check-raise Sevens and Deuces and Ace Seven. I'm the only one who has Ace King and Ace Queen, because they get three bet preflop."

- **Flop (A♠7♣2♦):** "So I'd go bet flop for like seventy-five percent pot, expect Deuces and Sevens to check-raise, right?"
- **Turn (Q♦):** "Get the Queen turn, or any turn. Let's say Queen of diamonds turn. I'd go ahead and bet the turn fairly big, say one twenty-five percents pot and my opponent would call whatever they call."
- **River (4♥):** "Then I'd get some river. Here we will put the Four out there. And I'd throw out another very big bet. I wasn't overbetting back then, but say you go all-in."

## Exploitation Strategy

### Putting Pressure on Capped Ranges

"The idea here is that because your opponent is sort of capped, your opponent does have two pairs sometimes, but he can't get away with calling you with only two pair, he has to call quite a bit wider and a lot of guys might not even have Ace Seven and Ace Deuce this often."

"So, unless he's willing to just flick in his stack with a hand like Ace Five or Ace Eight, he's going to massively overfold and bluffs print."

## Key Takeaways

"This is an example of a capped range. Against capped ranges we just use very, very big sizes and that is just kind of poker theory."

"So this is a way to exploit capped ranges. Just put a lot of pressure on them until your opponent proves to you that he's capable of making a light call because the concept of capped ranges implies that he'll never have a hand that's kind of naturally strong enough to call."
