# Blockers Concept

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Blockers

"I wanted to use this video to talk about blockers, an often misunderstood and misapplied concept."

"Now, the idea of blockers is that the cards that we hold affect the composition of the range of our opponent. I'll say that again in a different way. By virtue of me having certain cards, I weigh your range in a different way."

## Hand Example: A♦Q♣7♦

### Flop Blockers

"There's actually a blockers tab in this program, so it's fairly easy to see that if I, for example, go ahead and make a half-pot bet on the flop and click the blockers tab, you'll see that if I have an Ace, I get three point nine percent extra folds because I'm blocking an Ace."

"But the same is true for a card like the King of diamonds. Not by virtue of the King of diamonds necessarily having a lot of equity, just that the continuing range has many King high flush draws or hands like King Queen or King Jack or King Ten."

"So by virtue of just holding the King of diamonds, you get extra folds. That would be a good blocker for bluffing."

### Bad Blockers for Bluffing

"Could also look at bad blockers for bluffing, right? So, turn this the other way around and the cards that make our opponent fold less would be Nines, Eights, Sixes, Fives. These are kind of bad cards to hold."

"Why? Because when we bet, look at the hands he's folding, Sixes, Eights, Eight Nine, Nines, Six Five, pocket Fives."

"Of course, diamonds are better than non-diamonds. You're going to see lots of clubs, spades and hearts here. But the idea is, again, the more our hand interacts, the more it has this blocker type of effect."

### River Play (A♦Q♣7♦ 3♥ 6♦)

"And this is most pronounced generally on rivers, so I'm going to take us there."

"Let's say we have a turn Three of hearts. We go ahead and bet half pot and get called. Then river will be the Six of diamonds, so flush came in and we want to go all-in."

"Now, if we look at how the computer generated strategy would go, it would go with King Jack with a diamond or King Ten with a diamond, always. But much more rarely clubs, hearts and spades. And you would see the EV difference."

### Measuring the Effect

"I think this is fairly clear. You don't even need to see any percentages like how much does it affect? It's still interesting to look at."

"Basically when we shove, our opponent is going to fold roughly three percent extra when we hold a diamond compared to zero. And of course, there are some bad cards we could have. The Ten of hearts in this example would be a bad card."

### Alternative River: Busted Draw (A♦Q♣7♦ 3♥ 6♠)

"This is also interesting in terms of bluffing busted draws. Let's say the river is a Six of spades."

"You would see that we don't really want to bluff with hands like King Nine of diamonds. It would be a fairly big blunder because those hands are often in our opponent's folding range."

"And if we click the blockers tab, of course when we have an Ace he folds more, but having any diamond, even a Queen of diamonds, but any Eight, Jack, Nine, King, Ten of diamonds, is actually terrible for your fold equity."

### The Worst Blockers

"So you want to directly avoid this as much as you can and definitely avoid having a disastrous two diamonds."

"You can only imagine how bad bluffing with King Ten of diamonds is when you're looking for your opponent to fold King high diamonds, Queen high diamonds, and Ten high diamonds. He almost can't fold when you have King Ten of diamonds."

## Types of Blockers

### Good vs Bad Blockers

"So the idea of blockers... There are good blockers for bluffing. Draw comes in, you block the draw, that's a fairly standard one."

"There are bad blockers for bluffing, which would mean basically you block the folds, but the easiest way to conceptualize that is you block the draws that missed."

## Practical Application

### Professional Thinking

"So this is a fairly complicated concept. You guys don't have to get it right away. There are a million applications of this, and you will see them interwoven throughout hand analysis because this is something professional poker players think about in their decisions constantly."

### Flop Decision Making

"Even on the flop, when I'm thinking, do I c-bet, don't I c-bet? And I look at a hand like Ten Eight of hearts, I would immediately think, 'oh, this has poor blockers'."

"And maybe not and then I'd be, I'd think, 'oh, but the board is so good, I get to get away with it.' But if the board were worse, I wouldn't c-bet a hand like that."
