# Good Card Bad Card, Good Board Bad Board

## Introduction

"Okay, so good card, bad card, good board, bad board. Generally speaking, like we said, the guy with initiative, the guy who took the last aggressive action preflop. The preflop raiser ,are all different ways of saying the same thing ,is gonna have more high cards."

## The Core Principle

"So boards with high cards tend to favor him. Boards with low cards tend to favor the other player. And this is a really huge concept in poker that can help you make decisions quite a lot because it applies not only to the flop but also to the turn and to the river."

## Board Examples

### Low Board Example

"So I'll give you guys a hand example. Let's say that the board in the beginning comes 9, 7, 5. That's three low cards, generally speaking. Not a great board for the raiser."

"When the out of position player checks to the raiser, as he will most often do, the raiser will have sort of a mixed bag strategy. He's not gonna go super duper aggressive because the board isn't the best board for him."

### High Board Example

"Change the flop to the, to a board like king, queen three with two high cards and one very low card. And the very low cards actually get missed by people. Even though the defender plays low cards, he tends to avoid the deuce in the three as much as he can."

"So king, queen three, amazing board for the raiser. And this is a board where it's gonna start with a check and the raiser is gonna be able to apply a ton of pressure and is very likely going to bet with a very high frequency, even when he misses, due to this being such a good board for him."

### Bluffing Opportunities

"And so by recognizing this is an amazing board, you have a great bluffing opportunity on it. Whereas 9, 7, 5, which is more of a medium board you could bluff, but you don't have to, you're not gonna bet every time it's more of a in between board. And something like 4, 5, 6 is a good board for the caller. And there you wouldn't bet very often as the preflop raiser."

## How to Evaluate Boards

"So we have good boards and bad boards and the way to tell them apart is very straightforward. The more high cards, the better for the raiser. The more low cards, the better for the caller."

### Connectedness Factor

"Similarly, as the board gets more connected, it's better for the caller. Uh, reason for that is that hands like Aces and Kings and Ace King make good one pair of hands. So as the boards get very connected and one pairs are worth less money, that's better for the caller."

### Suitedness Factor

"Similarly, as the board gets more suited, it's better for the caller because it devalues these Aces, Kings Queens, Ace King, the raiser's advantage."

### Board Texture Rankings

"So if I were to rank boards and we said king, queen three is good for the raiser, well if it were rainbow, that would be the best one. Two-tone would be the next best one, and monotone would be the worst one."

"And it would be significantly worse for the raiser because suddenly your opponent can have a flush and maybe your set of Kings or your pocket Aces are not winning the pot as often. So this is how we evaluate good flop and bad flop."

## Turn and River Cards

"And the same thing applies for turns in rivers. So let's say board came 10, six deuce, I'd say relatively good board for the raiser because the 10 is a bit high and the deuce and the six are so disconnected. And the deuce is so low that they don't get hit very often."

"So the big blind checks, we fire a bet and he calls. Now if we think about the possible turn cards, we can think which of them are good for us and which of them are bad for us."

### Card Rankings by Turn

"So deuce 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, a bit bad for the raiser. Those are gonna improve the caller's range more than the raiser's range. Jack, queen, king, ace are very good for the raiser. They're gonna improve him a lot more than the caller."

## Strategy Adjustments

"And so our strategy and the way that we lean changes a lot depending on this perception of whether the turn was a good card for us or a bad card for us."

### Good Card Strategy

"If the turn was a good card. Generally speaking, we're going to continue very aggressively both with good hands and with bluffs."

### Bad Card Strategy

"And we're gonna check back a lot of medium strength hands if the turn is a bad card for us. So ten six deuce. An example of a bad card would be say a seven. We're now going to be less aggressive. We're gonna check back kind of more medium hands, but also more weak hands. We can't bluff as often and then we even sometimes check some strong hands as traps."

## Hand Devaluation Example

"They also got a bit devalued. If you think of something like Kings on 10 six deuce, seven, suddenly you're losing to eight, nine, you're losing to six seven, you're losing to pocket sevens. So you start losing to more and more hands as the board starts favoring the other player."

"And so you might consider checking something like Kings or Aces back on the turn sometimes, which is a very advanced concept, but certainly those hands are not worth nearly as much as if the turn were a higher card."

## Application and Defense

"So you had this concept of a good board, bad board, good card, bad card should help you a lot in making decisions and also understanding the context of your opponent's decisions. Your opponent gets to be a lot more aggressive on good boards and good run outs and he gets to be a lot less aggressive on the other ones."

"So if someone raises and you called and you get a bad flop, you know, very easy to fold, you don't have to defend very much. If you got a good flop, you're going to be a lot stickier and a lot tougher to get off your hand. And vice versa with the turns in river."

## Accepting the Dynamics

"So ten six deuce turn as a king, great card for your opponent, just a bad spot for you to be in. Cards didn't fall your way. So you're gonna do a lot of folding and he gets to bluff you a lot. Like it's fine that he might be bluffing, he gets to bluff. That's the way the interactions work."

## Conclusion

"Very, very useful, very important concept. And as we go further down the line with the videos, you guys will understand and see how to implement it better and better."
