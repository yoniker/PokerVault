# Range Asymmetry and Broadways

## Core Concepts

### Introduction

"Hey guys, what's up? This video is going to be about a concept I call range asymmetry and what is a broadway. This is very relevant for three bet pots but it's also relevant for hand reading in general."

### Broadway Definition

"So a broadway is a general term that we use in poker to say Jack or higher or Ten or higher. And the reason we use it is that people play more broadways than non-broadways."

"And so boards with broadways get hit more by ranges, whereas low boards get hit less."

### Board Texture Impact

"So Deuce Four Seven tough to have stuff, whereas King Queen Jack, very easy to have stuff, right?"

"So on Deuce Four Seven, something like Ace Seven is fairly strong, on King Queen Jack, Aces isn't that strong. Of course I put a connected and a disconnected, but even Seven Five Four versus Ace King Jack, the strength of a top pair type of hand is going to be very different."

### Position-Dependent Broadway Definition

"What is a broadway? A broadway depends on ranges. So I want to walk you guys through this for a bit."

"We're just going to look in Lucid at ranges of these, let's say five players. Hijack, you guys can see, opens. And on the left, this is the offsuit region. I'm going to call a broadway something that's represented in the offsuit region."

"The reason for this, if you look at Queen Jack offsuit, that's twelve combinations, whereas Queen Jack suited is four, so the offsuit region carries a lot more weight."

### Broadway Cards by Position

"When you raise the hijack, is an Ace a broadway? In the lojack range, we would say, what's a broadway here? Something... a Queen or a King or an Ace would count as a broadway. These get hit a lot. And a Jack also. And a Ten is... barely a broadway here."

"If we go to the hijack range, now the Ten is more of a broadway."

"If we go to the cutoff range, Ten is definitely a broadway. And even Nine starts being a bit."

"And if we go to the button range, button plays every Nine. So when the button raises, actually, if the board is King... Say, Ace King Nine, that's a triple broadway board in a way, right? Because the Nine gets hit very much."

## Three Betting Dynamics

### Small Blind Three Betting Range

"Now, the reason I mentioned this is because of three betting ranges. Let's take an example, say cutoff raises, and it's folded to the small blind."

"Here in orange, the range of the small blind three bets with, and you guys should be able to see that when we get to... say Ten or lower, the small blind doesn't really have many of those. Nine or lower, definitely, but even Ten or lower. It mostly has Ace, King, Queen, Jack."

"So these are what we would term broadways and these are the cards that we would expect the small blind to hit a lot more."

### Range Concentration Effect

"Now, when the range is more narrow in terms of cards, it hits. It hits them harder. A larger proportion of the range hits them. And when it misses, it misses harder."

### Hand Reading in Three Bet Pots

"So a lot of hand reading in these three bet pots is going to be how many broadways are there?"

"Where if the board is Jack high, Queen high, King high... A lot of this region made a pair."

### Three Bettor Strategy on High Boards

"So the strategy for the three bettor is going to be, he's just going to be very aggressive and he's going to use hands like King Queen, Ace Queen, Ace King, just as bluffs."

### Three Bettor Strategy on Low Boards

"Whereas if it's a board with no broadways... Here let's say a Nine high, Ten high, Eight high board, none of these hands hit, none of this region hit, so the out of position player needs to play a lot more defensively."

"He can't use all of these hands as bluffs. And actually he wants to try showing down a hand like Ace King and Ace Queen. So he has to play a lot more defensively."

"He's going to split his range earlier. He's going to be more defensive, less aggressive... Actually have to do some trapping with Aces so that you don't just get run over whenever you have Ace King."

### Range Construction Differences

"So this is very, very determined by how many broadways are on the board and the range asymmetries."

"And just to show what I mean by range asymmetries, this would be the range of the three bettor. But the guy calling would have a range that looks like this."

"So the main difference is going to be more of the low pocket pairs, more of the suited connectors, more of the low suited Aces, and less of the high offsuit broadways like King Queen offsuit and Ace Jack offsuit."

"So he's going to be more low card heavy, less high card heavy. This is a big difference between the ranges."

"Of course, less Aces and Kings and Ace King and Ace Queen because these hands four bet."

## Key Takeaways

"So the calling range hits the low boards more, the raising range hits the high boards more."
