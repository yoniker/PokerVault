# SPR Principles

## Core Concepts

### Stack to Pot Ratio Definition

"Hey guys, what's up? This is gonna be about SPR principles. SPR is stack to pot ratio and what it means is how much money is in the pot versus how much money you have behind."

"This is a key thing to be aware of in poker since it dictates a lot of what your hand wants to do."

### How SPR Changes Hand Value

"The principle of how much money there is behind is gonna dictate how we value and how we maneuver with our hands."

"It's gonna change us from playing very cautiously when a flush comes in and we have an overpair to just being, oh, flush came in, I don't care. There's not enough behind. Close your eyes and stick in your stack."

## Hand Examples

### QQ with High SPR

"I'll give you guys a simple example. So imagine there's $10 in the pot and you have a million dollars behind and the board comes say ten eight six two-tone. If you have something like QQ, you better tread carefully because as the pot grows, your hand is not gonna be worth very much and you really only kind of want a small pot."

"So you might be pot controlling, you know, lots of bad runouts for you. And this would be true even if there's $10 and you know, $500 behind even $10 and $200 behind, it's just difficult to get all the cards coming together where you want to put in a stack with QQ."

"So we might pot control."

### Queens with Different SPRs

"Now, change this to something like a three bet pot or a four bet pot. Very often you'll be in a situation where maybe there's a hundred dollars in a pot and you have $250 behind in this kind of situation, a hand like Queens does much better and it's suddenly just good enough to put all the money in."

"Now it didn't get stronger in an absolute sense, it's just that the total amount of money possible to put in happens to suit a hand strength like Queens. And given that you get to play it a lot more aggressively."

### Aces on Queen Nine Three

"So yeah, I guess final example, we have Aces, it comes Queen nine three, we bet and our opponent calls. Turn nine. That brings in the flush if there is a high SPR."

"So you have a lot of money behind. Say there's $50 in the pot and you have $400 behind. Aces is now in a rough spot. We're gonna check and hope our opponent doesn't put in a lot of money on the river if there is not a lot of money behind."

"So say there's $50 in the pot and we have $40 behind, we're just gonna close our eyes and go all in. And if he has a spade, so be it. But we're ahead enough and there's enough in the pot already where it doesn't matter."

## Key Takeaways

"And yeah, this is just a big, big principle to help you guys play reraised pots"
