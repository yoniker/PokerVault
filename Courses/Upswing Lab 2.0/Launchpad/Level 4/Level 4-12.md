# Playing Three Bet Pots When We Miss

## Core Concepts

### Introduction

"I want to practice how to play in three bet pots when we miss, and I'm going to show this with Lucid again."

"The idea is going to be how do we play our hands when we miss. And it's very connected to the rest of the concepts in this chapter of how many broadways are on the board and how good or bad is the board for us."

### Setup and Range

"So let's say button raises, we re-raise from the small blind with this kind of range. And if you guys, maybe you're re-raising a slightly tighter range, that's fine, I wouldn't worry about it at this stage."

"We're just going to look at a few different boards and discuss how we play when we miss."

### Range-Based Thinking

"To summarize, and I think this is a lot of the concept in this chapter, rather than think about our hand, and if we have nothing we check, we have something good we bet, we think about our range."

"We think of the range as where is the Broadway region? What are the good cards for us and the bad cards for us?"

## Playing Good Boards

### K♠J♠4♦ - Double Broadway Board

"Let's start with a board that's very good for us. Say, King Jack Four. Double-broadway board. The way that we play when we miss here is going to be to bet. Because the board is so good for us."

"Say we re-raised with Ace Seven of diamonds, or Six Seven of hearts, Ace Seven of hearts, pocket Sevens, whatever. We completely missed the board."

"The idea that we would have in our head is that despite completely missing the board, our range hits the board so hard that our re-raising range and our opponent is imagining Kings and Queens and Ace King and Aces and all these hands hitting and King Queen, that we get to bet these hands and he's going to be faced with a tough decision a lot, so we start out with a bet."

### Continuing Aggression on Good Boards

"This Lucid program can give you all sorts of sizes. There are big bet strategies and small bet strategies. But let's say you bet there, you get Ace Seven of hearts and we're now out of position."

"When we're out of position we prioritize bluffing with equity. But here we can actually keep firing with a lot of our misses very, very aggressively."

"To give you an example, say you have pocket Fives,you bet the turn and you got called, you can keep firing. If you have something like Ace Ten, which isn't too strong, or Ace Queen, you can keep firing. It's just a board to be very, very aggressive on."

"Queen Nine, Ten Nine. Even say you hit the Seven with your Ace Seven, you can just turn it into a bluff."

"And of course, because we're out of position, so we prioritize bluffing with equity, we're going to give up with... Say you have Ace Five of clubs. You mostly give up, but it's actually not even a disaster to keep bluffing with this hand sometimes. So good is the board for you, right?"

## Playing Medium Boards

### 9♠9♥4♦ - A More Defensive Approach

"The counter example to this would be a bad board for us when we miss or relatively, I'm not going to put Seven Six Five, but just a lower board. Say Nine Nine Four."

"Nine Nine Four, when we miss, we have to play more defensively. Here, you'll notice there's a spade, a heart and a diamond on the board, so the worst hand for us to hold would be something with clubs."

"And if we have something like Ace Seven of clubs, we just check and just fold if our opponent bets and we play a bit of defense with our checking range."

### Maintaining Some Aggression

"But we also do bet quite a lot. This is going to be generally the pattern in a re-raised pot. You do have an advantage, even on boards that you miss, because of your overpairs."

"So unless the board is really terrible, you do get to keep betting quite a lot, even with King Jack or Ace Queen or Ace Eight. So it's never a disaster to just fire the first bet in."

### Turn Play on Bad Cards (9♠9♥4♦ 8♠)

"And let's say we go for a half pot bet, our opponent calls and the turn is the Eight of spades. Another turn that our range misses. We now play very, very defensively."

"So our Ace Kings, Ace Queens, King Queen, King Jack, Ace Jack, Ace Five suited... all these hands are mostly going to be checking. And we keep betting as a bluff mostly with hands, like straight draws and flush draws."

"And then our big pairs play a mix of offense and defense."

### Example with Ace King

"So, say we have Ace King here, we fired the first bet, our opponent called. We're now going to check the Eight."

"Then, facing a bet from him we're going to decide between calling and folding and it's going to be close, right? So there's no easy answer. Folding is definitely fine."

### Good Turn Cards (9♠9♥4♦ K♦)

"Now, what if we missed on the flop we fired a bet and then we got a good turn card? Say, a King, right? We still have this range asymmetry. We have a lot of Kings."

"Well if we bet, we turn the King, suddenly it's good card for us again and we just keep firing even though we missed."

"So something like Ace Seven of spades or Six Seven of clubs that mostly would've given up, given we got a really good turn card for our range, they get to be more aggressive."

## Playing Bad Boards

### 7♥6♥5♠ - Complete Defense

"And maybe just for completeness, we'll look at what happens if the board is actually quite bad for us. So say something like Seven Six Five, right? Low board, connected board, but also one where our opponent makes many nuts."

"And here we actually just check everything."

### Understanding Range Disadvantage

"The idea behind this is if the ranges are not symmetrical. Most of the boards we're going to have the advantage and we're going to bet even if our broadway region miss, but here our opponent made so many good hands, our Aces are even not that strong."

"So now he has the advantage and we basically hand the ball over to him. It's his move since he has a stronger range."

### Playing Strong Hands Defensively

"It's a very important concept. There's a lot of guys will not be sure what to do with a King here. The answer is, if you have Ace King here, just check. If you have King Queen just check."

"Just recognize that it's a bad board for you. So you start out with checking and you play everything defensively. Aces, Kings, Ace King, everything."

"And then when your opponent bets, you'll have a close decision with Ace King. But you'll also have an easy decision with Aces sometimes."

"So you won't feel like when you check you're always weak or something like that, you actually check your strong hands as well."
