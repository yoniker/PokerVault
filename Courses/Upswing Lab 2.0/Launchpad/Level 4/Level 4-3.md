# The Concept of Initiative

## Introduction

"Hey guys. In this video I'm going to be talking about the concept of initiative and how it relates to good cards and bad cards and good boards and bad boards. And this is closely intertwined with preflop ranges and postflop ranges, so it all kind of goes together."

"But even if you're not yet proficient with ranges, these are concepts which you can use because the heuristics tend to be very simple and straightforward and repeat themselves regardless of positions."

## The Fundamental Idea

"So the general, basic, fundamental idea behind this whole concept is that the raiser, the first raiser in the hand has all of his good hands, and he picks, say the top twenty or the top thirty. It's always a top something percent of hands that he could raise."

"And this creates a natural weighing of his range towards high cards, there are always going to be more Aces than there are Deuces in their range unless you're playing Seven Deuce or some crazy poker format. So all of the raising ranges are going to be high card heavy."

## The Defender's Range

"Here we see an example of an under the gun raising range. Now, versus a range when you defend, for example, from the blinds, which we can do here, when we see the flop, we're going to have the calling range."

"And the calling range is going to lack the top of the range. The top of the range of the defender is putting in another raise. And for that reason, when the defender only calls that top, like Aces, Kings, Ace King, Queens, et cetera, is generally missing."

## Getting Odds to Call

"And secondly, the defender gets odds to call his bet because there's already money in the hand and possibly he's closing the action. So he tends to continue wider than the opener. Due to this, it's okay for his hands to win less than half of the time."

"For example, if you're in the big blind, someone raises to three big blinds, everyone folds to you. You need to call two. After you call, the pot is going to be six and a half. You don't need to win half the time so you get to call weaker hands."

## The Classic Asymmetry

"And this creates the classic asymmetry, which is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to explain in this video. And that's that the raiser has more high pairs and more high cards, whereas the caller has more low cards. And that's really all you need to remember in order to understand the concepts of initiative, good card, bad card."

## Range Advantage on the Flop

"Okay, so what happens when we see a flop? Generally speaking, and this is a broad generalization, but it is correct over ninety percent of the time, when we look at the entire range of each player, the raiser has an advantage."

"The reason for this is A, that he has more high card hands such as Aces, Kings, Queens, Ace King, Ace Queen. And B, that he has less of the weaker types of hands. So generally speaking his range is at an advantage."

"The only exception would be boards which are very, very low and connected. So Four-Five-Six type of boards might counter this, and suddenly the low cards are better than the high cards. But other than very, very low and connected boards, the raiser has the advantage."

## Advantage Speaks First

"And the way poker works is whoever has the advantage gets to speak first. Generally speaking, this is the way poker strategy works. And the reason is that when you have the advantage, you tend to put a lot of pressure on your opponent, whether it's by bluffing or betting your good hands. Either one, the player who has the advantage is the one to do this first."

"And if you think of any situation in life when there's a big strong guy and a small weak guy, generally the small weak guy isn't going to pick a fight with a big strong guy, it's going to be the other way around. So the same thing happens in poker."

## The Donk Bet Problem

"Stronger range is going to speak first and this creates a situation where when you call from the big blind, we start out by checking everything. When you're not familiar with this concept of initiative, it's very common to lead out. And this is also called a donk bet in poker slang, to lead out with some of your hands."

"But because you're at a disadvantage, when you start building the pot with some of your hands, the times you check you're at even more of a disadvantage. And so this type of strategy, it doesn't work long term. And generally speaking, once someone does this, you can label them as a beginner."

"They're not really familiar with the concept of initiative, and whenever they check they're going to be very, very weak. They're basically betting when they hit, maybe they're bluffing a bit, but in terms of the strength of the ranges, they can truly get away with this. So there's going to be a weakness somewhere. And yeah, the general recommendation is start out with a check."

## The Initiative Game

"And now we get into this initiative game, which is almost like an unspoken rules of conduct. Just like we say, the small guy doesn't pick a fight with a big guy, but if the big guy hits him, he'll hit him back."

"So at any point in the hand there is someone with a betting lead, unless something special happens, he's going to keep the betting lead. So most hands start with big blind check the guy in position has the betting lead. If he bets and the big blind calls, big blind is going to check again on the turn kind of eyes closed, because he's checking to the guy with a betting lead, he's checking to the guy with initiative. And the same on the river, broadly speaking."

## When Initiative Shifts

"Now, when does this shift? If you have the initiative but you choose not to bet, you choose to check, you've basically given up the initiative and you pan the ball to the next guy."

"So imagine again, the strong guy and the weak guy. The weak guy says, 'I'm not doing anything'. And then strong guy says, 'I'm not doing anything either'. And then the weak guy says, 'oh, that's interesting. You're not doing anything. Okay, maybe there's something weak about you, even though you seem strong, I'm going to pick a fight now'."

## Telegraphing Weakness

"So that's the idea in poker where, say you raise, the big blind called, he checks to you, which you would do automatically, and you decide to check back. You're now telegraphing weakness because, similar to preflop where he would've raised all his good hands, he would've re-raised you with his best hands, you would've generally bet most of your best hands."

"And now that they're missing, he gets to take the betting lead and he gets to start betting into you. So now he has the initiative. If he checks, he hands the ball back to you. If he bets, he still has it."

## Understanding the Flow

"So try to picture this initiative in poker. It's a big part of what's going on in a lot of situations. I think most guys who are very experienced at poker just know this and are not even aware they know this, but a lot to understanding hands, any hand that you watch or any hand that you play is having this invisible concept of whether you call it initiative, or manners, or rules of conduct, we check to the guy with a betting lead."

"He's the one dictating the action. Of course we can, once he bets, we can raise and now we have the betting lead. And then if we check, we hand the betting lead back to him. And these kinds of things go on and on and on."

## Three-Betting Example

"Now, to give you guys another few examples, say the guy preflop raised from under the gun and we three bet him from the big blind, and he called. Who has the betting lead now? Whoever made the last aggressive action, which is us. So now we have the betting lead and we can start out betting. We don't have to check to him because he would've re-raised our three bet with his best hands. Of course, if we check to him, we give up the betting lead, he can now bet."

## Looking Forward

"So yeah, this is, generally speaking, the concept of initiative. In the next video, I'm going to explain the idea of good card, bad card, good board, bad board."
