# Combinatorics and Relative Hand Strength

## Introduction

"First we're gonna look at a seven deuce and we're gonna count how many hands beat our top pair, top kicker."

## Ace Seven Deuce Board Analysis

### The Setup

"So our ace came. So if we raised from the button opponent called in the big blind, he can have sevens, he can have deuces, he can have ace seven, he can have ace deuce. And in some games he's gonna have seven deuces. But let's rule that one out for a second because we'll assume he folded it. And then the next best hand is ace king."

### Counting Combos That Beat King on A72

"So how many hands does a king lose to? Now the way you do combinatorics and poker is not extremely important. It's very repetitive. So all you have to do is remember there are three combinations of sets. There are nine combinations of two pair."

"When you have both off suit and suited versions, that's because there are four aces and four deuces with one ace counted four of each. There are three of each left. So three times three is nine and top pair top kicker type hand is not actually important because we're actually seeing how many combos we lose to."

"So if we have a king on ace seven deuce, there are 24 combinations in our opponents range that we lose to. So this is the 25th best combo."

### The Target Range

"If we think of our bets as narrowing our opponent's range more and more, we definitely want to keep his range above 50. Combos way above, because once it's 50, we're just winning half the pot."

## Ten Nine Eight Board Analysis

### Pocket Eights as a Set

"Now compare this to 10, 9, 8. And let's look at a hand like pocket eights. So a set, what beats pocket eights?"

"Well, queen jack, queen jack, we now have four queens and four jacks at 16 combos. There's jack seven suited. That's four. There's six, seven suited, that's another four. And we have tens and nines. These are each three."

"And if we add these up, we actually get to 30. So eights is beat by 30 combos."

### The Comparison

"And it is a similar hand strength to ace king on the previous flop that we saw (A72). Even though one is top pair, top kicker and one is a set. Of course they have other different properties, how well they're doing when they're behind, how well they're doing. When they're ahead"

### Top Pair Top Kicker on T98

"But imagine 10, 9, 8, and you have top pair, top kicker (AT), not pocket eight. So eights we had 30. Let's look at something like Ace 10. How many hands are you losing to at ace 10."

"So we have tens, nines, eights, we have 10, nine, which like we said is nine combinations. We have 10, eight or another nine, we have eight, nine or another nine. Of course our opponent will not have jacks queens kings and aces because those would be three betting."

"But add these up and we get 60 Combos."

## The Key Insight

"So what you guys can see is that top pair, top kicker on ace seven deuce is the 25th best combo. Whereas top pair, top kicker on ten nine eight is the 60th best combo. So is significantly, significantly worse hand."

"And even though both of these are top pair, top kicker, you want to be playing them very differently."

## Looking Forward

"So as I'm going to walk you guys through hands and how to play them, we have to keep these nuances in mind. Not all boards are created equal. And we'll try to discuss not only the hands, but also the boards."
