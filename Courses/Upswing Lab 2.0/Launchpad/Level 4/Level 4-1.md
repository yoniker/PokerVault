# The Concept of Reciprocity

## Introduction

"Hey guys, I want to talk about the concept of reciprocity. This is a concept I heard about from Tommy Angelo, a well-known poker writer and coach."

## What Is Reciprocity?

"And the idea of reciprocity is that the way that poker works is not like a normal game works. So reciprocity means kind of what comes around, goes around."

## The Balance of Poker

"So sometimes I'm going to have Aces, you're going to have Kings. The same amount of times it's going to be the other way around. Sometimes I'm going to have a flush draw and get there, and sometimes you're going to have a flush draw get there against me."

## What Really Determines Winning

"And so what determines whether you win or lose in poker is not 'how did the session go? I won six buy-ins. I'm amazing.' But it's rather 'you need to win more when you have the best hand than the other guy would. If the roles were reversed then you need to lose less when you're losing than if the roles were reversed.'"

## A Better Way to Judge Performance

"I think that viewing and thinking about poker in this way will give you kind of a better idea and a better way to judge how you're doing."

"And you might have a losing session and say, 'wow, I played amazing today.' And you might have a winning session and say, 'oh, I actually played terrible'. Because lucky days happen, I would win no matter what but I didn't maximize my winnings."

## The Core Philosophy

"And I think this is generally a good approach to have and a good way to think about a lot of things in poker."

## The Key Takeaway

"So kind of stay focused and be like, it's not about waiting to make a good hand. It's about winning the most in every hand when you can and losing the least when you can't."
