# The sweet spot

## Introduction to Ranges

"So I wanted to talk about what happens to ranges as money goes in. When you get to the flop, you have a certain range of hands that you could have."

"And speaking and thinking in ranges is something that we're going to do more and more in poker. It's more difficult in the beginning but you get used to it."

## Understanding Combinations

"So for example, we might say, when I get to the flop, I'm going to have all of these hands. You guys can see the metrics, the offsuit hands on the left, the suited hands on the right, the pocket pairs of the middle. So we're going to have, say all of these."

"You can actually count combinations. A pocket pair, there are six ways of making a pocket pair, four ways of making a suited hand, twelve ways of making an offsuit hand."

"And if you count the combinations, like Deuce of hearts, Deuce of diamonds; Deuce of hearts, Deuce of spades, et cetera., this is three hundred and eighty-two combinations."

## Card Removal Effect

"Put in a board... so Ace Seven Deuce two-tone. And you go back and is it still three hundred and eighty-two? And the answer is no. If the Ace and the Seven and the Deuce are there and we click display card removal, it becomes three hundred and thirty-nine because some of the cards are on the board."

## The Extremes of Betting

"Imagine there's a dollar in the pot and your opponent bets ten gazillion dollars. At this point, we would fold absolutely everything except for the very best hand, which would be pocket Aces, right? So we would narrow from three hundred and thirty-nine to just one combo."

"On the counter end of that spectrum, imagine there are a million dollars in the pot and your opponent bets one dollar. We wouldn't fold anything. We just keep all our hands."

## The Core Concept: Betting Narrows Ranges

"What I'm getting at, and kind of the important concept here, is that as your opponent bets, he narrows your range. So the bigger he bets, the more combinations we fold."

"And this can be over multiple streets, but this three hundred and thirty-nine combination range will narrow street by street depending on how much money a player puts in."

## The Pocket Sixes Example

"Now, imagine that your opponent has something like pocket Sixes. Pocket Sixes has forty-five percent equity against this range. Does that mean pocket Sixes wants to put in money against this range? The answer is probably not, right? This is not a range against which pocket Sixes is doing well."

"If it were to put in money and none of this range would fold, that wouldn't be good for it. But in practice, if you put in money with Sixes, some of this range will fold and so your equity will shift."

## The Pot-Sized Bet Rule

"A good shortcut to think about it is that versus a pot-sized bet, roughly half the range folds. So if someone with Sixes were to bet pot-size, we dropped to one hundred and seventy combos, but we'd also drop to the top one hundred and seventy combos."

"And just to show you guys what this looks like, imagine a pot-sized bet from a hand like Sixes. And now I'm going to pick just hearts here. What happens when we drop this range? And just, we're just taking out hands, right? So just hearts, so all the flush draws, right? This is a hundred and seventy combos. So basically Seven or better and flush draws."

## Equity Shift After Betting

"I remember before Sixes had forty-five percent, how much is it going to have now? Fifteen. Now imagine the pot is ten dollars. Before, if you had Sixes and you check down, you would get four and a half dollars back. Now you put in a pot-size bet, you got some folds, but the resulting part, you're getting very little of it back."

## Hand Devaluation Through Betting

"This concept is connected to how much money does each hand want to put in. So Sixes the answer is, very little, how much money it wants to put in. Because very quickly it's just putting in money bad."

"And imagine the pot is this big. Any money you put in, you're basically bluffing. If you put in more money with Sixes, right? And Sixes was better than a bluff before. But by virtue of growing the pot, you have made it as bad as not having any cards. So you've devalued your hand, you've made your Sixes into an Eight Three offsuit equivalent in terms of how good they are."

## Finding the Sweet Spot

"But say we had something like Kings. How would Kings do here? The answer is forty-five percent. Is this the optimal point for Kings? Probably not. I think you want to be winning more than half of the time when you put in money. So this is maybe too big for Kings as well."

"And this is kind of a way to visualize the fact that every hand strength that you have, where now I'm talking made hands, has a sweet spot against your opponent's range of how big of a pot it wants to play."

## Different Hands, Different Pot Sizes

"And what we're going to explore in these further videos is how to recognize that sweet spot in a simple way with heuristics. You aim for a pot-size where your hand gets the maximum because, say we have Aces. With ninety-three percent equity, we want a really big pot. And with Kings, we want a medium sized one."

"And with Ace King, how big of a pot do you want? Or with Ace Five, how big of a pot do you want, right? Ace Five is a lot better than Kings, but it's not as good as some people think it is in terms of what happens when you fire out a big bet."

## The Goal: Recognition and Navigation

"So we're going to aim to get you guys relatively proficient at navigating your hand to pot that it wants to get to and to recognizing... I think the main key here is going to be recognition because it changes how many players are in the pot, what did they do, what's the board texture, et cetera."

## The Abstract Concept in Practice

"So there is this abstract concept in poker. Imagine each player has his full range of hands, and we often see this as a chart. So here if under the gun would raise, it would get folded to the big blind. Big blind would be flatting, all of these hands in green. And then on some board, he would have all of these hand combinations in his range."

## Multiple Streets of Narrowing

"Every bet that we make, he's going to fold some hands and continue some hands and his range gets narrower. So imagine the board is something like Ace Seven Deuce and we make a pot-size bet. Against a pot-size bet our opponent will fold roughly half of his hands."

"Now, turn is a Nine. We make another pot-size bet. He folds another half of his hands. River is whatever. We make another pot-size bet, he folds another half of his hands."

"So you guys can imagine how, by the time we threw in three pot-size bets, the range of hands our opponent is still in, the hand width is actually very, very narrow. And this is a crucial concept in poker."

## The Ace Queen Example

"And this basically helps you navigate with any hand that you have because as his range gets narrower... So, say the board is Ace Seven Deuce and we go pot, pot, all-in on the river with Ace Queen. By the time we went all-in, our opponent's range has narrowed so much that Ace Queen is no longer a favorite to win the pot."

"So this is not the line you want to take with Ace Queen. The line is somewhere in between where we make the pot big while remaining a decent favorite. And this is generally what we're going to try to be doing with our good hands."

## Sets and Board Texture

"Now, the very best hands we can have are sets. Sets, generally speaking, some dry board would like to find a way to get all the money in because no matter how much you narrow down your opponent's range, the set is still the effective nuts."

"And when the board gets more connected, however, this changes very quickly. So I want to do a very quick combinatorics exercise in relative hand strength."
