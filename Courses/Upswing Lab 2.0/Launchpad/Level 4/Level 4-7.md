# Playing Ace Seven Deuce Board

## Core Concepts

### Hand Categories and Betting Goals

"How do we play Ace Seven Deuce? Well, if we have something like a set or top two, we're trying to put all the money in some way."

### Understanding Opponent Tendencies

"Some guys, when you bet, they'll check-raise anything that beats Ace King, so if they only call, you know you have the best hand and then you can keep piling in money. And if this is true of your opponent, Ace King wants many bets."

"If it's less true and they do more slow playing, I'd say two big bets is enough for a hand like Ace King."

### Board Development Considerations

"On Ace Seven Deuce, you don't actually have to fire the third bet because two other cards are going to roll off. Say, an Eight and a Four. Your opponent is going to have Ace Eight and Ace Four and pocket Eights and Seven Eights. So there are more and more hands that beat you as more cards roll off."

"The third big bet with Ace King is generally not the best idea."

### Bluff-Catching Reality

"Generally speaking, when we're faced with a bluff-catching decision, the value of our hand declines a lot. In theory it's zero, in practice maybe you have a good way to make the decision."

"The main thing I would want for you guys is to be able to accept if you have Kings, you check back, and your opponent threw two big bets in, you're just not winning a lot of money in that hand. Whether you call or fold is not the key issue. The key issue is to recognize it's not a great spot."

## Hand Examples

### Playing Ace King

"If we have something like Ace King, it kind of depends. We definitely want between two and three bets. We generally don't want to go all-in."

### Playing Ace Eight (Top Pair No Kicker)

"What if we have something like Ace Eight on Ace Seven Deuce? So a top pair with no kicker. With a hand like this, we want something around two medium-sized bets."

"This hand is losing to significantly more hands in our opponent's range. Ace Nine, Ace Ten, Ace Jack, maybe Ace Queen, so we can't afford to narrow his range as much."

"A hand like Ace Eight would generally either go bet-bet-check back, it could go check back-bet-bet, it could go bet-check-bet. Sometimes it's only going to be one bet, but we're talking one to two bets in terms of where we're aiming for with Ace Eight."

### Playing Pocket Kings

"What about something like Pocket Kings on Ace Seven Deuce? Pocket Kings is in the unenviable position of being a strong hand, but one that's not really able to build a pot confidently."

"KK  generally wants one to one and a half bets to go in, but it doesn't really need much protection. If it's ahead it's way ahead. It doesn't mind giving away free cards."

"This is a hand where you either bet small to medium and then try to take it to showdown or you check back and try to take it to showdown."

"By virtue of having this medium hand strength, we start out the hand being aware that if our opponent decides he wants to play a big pot, Kings is in trouble and it's just not going to be worth very much."

"The money from Kings comes from the times your opponent doesn't put a lot of money in."

### Playing Lower Pairs

"If you have a lower pair, Eights for example, or Sixes, those hands are more in the one bet range and they would like to do it earlier rather than later to get protection. Of course they don't have to, but it is a small preference."

"So if I had to bet one and check one on the flop I'd bet Eights and check Kings, of course you can check both or bet both. Either way is fine."

### Playing a Seven

"What about a Seven? Like 87s. Seven is similar to Kings. You're going to want one bet in. Doesn't have to be early, you can try to check it down and see the runout. You can bet once and then start checking down."

"Don't make two bets yourself or you're narrowing your opponent's range down to a point where your Seven is no longer likely to win a showdown."

### Playing Air

"What about if we have air? Many different types of air here, but generally speaking, if you have air, you either give up or you bluff and they're both okay options. I wouldn't worry about it too much."

"The one thing I would mention is that Ace high boards and disconnected boards tend to favor the preflop raiser, which means your Ace Kings are fairly strong. Your opponent's Eight Five suited, or whatever that he called, are fairly weak."

"So you generally want to take at least one bet at the pot. And on these kind of boards when you miss, I think bluffing is... It's almost mandatory to fire at least one bluff."

"How many bluffs do you fire and when do you fire them is up to you. But don't go checking down Ten high just because you missed. You should take at least one shot at the pot."

### Playing Draws

"What if we have a flush draw or a straight draw or a gutshot draw? How do we play these hands? Well, when we're the in position preflop raiser, it's kind of easy and there are no real wrong choices."

"You can bluff with these hands. And the idea with bluffing is, sometimes your opponents fold and sometimes you suddenly turn or river the nuts, and then you are actually value betting all along."

"So these hands make very good and very frequent hands to bet flop and turn. And then make a decision on the river whether or not you keep bluffing, or if you hit, how big you bet. I think that should be the default for these hands."

### The Deceptive Check-Back Option

"It's important to mention that in poker you can be tricky and it's fine to check these hands back on the flop or on the turn. By these hands I mean draws, flush draws, or open-enders, gutshots..."

"It's fine to check them back on the flop or on the turn. And then if you hit, it's more disguised and you prevent your opponent from check-raising you. That's also a reasonable option."

"So we're going to default to being aggressive with these hands in position, but keep the option in the back of our mind, and we'll learn further down the line when and how to use this, of checking these hands back being more deceptive and suddenly showing up with a straight or a flush in a spot your opponent doesn't really expect."
