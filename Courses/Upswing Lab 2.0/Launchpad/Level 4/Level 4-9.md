# Comparing Different Board Textures

## Core Concepts

### Board Texture Overview

"Hey guys, I want to run you through a few more boards as quickly as we can. So we've covered Ace Seven Deuce, we've covered Ten Nine Eight two-tone. Let's cover a board like Ace King Queen, Deuce Deuce Three, and Ten Ten Eight. These three. Very different boards."

"We'll see how on each board our relative hand strength is very, very different."

## Board Analysis: Ace King Queen

### Pocket Pairs Are Devalued

"When we look at a board like Ace King Queen, any pair below the Queen is not worth very much."

"So even if you have something strong like Jacks, Tens, Nines, Eights... these hands are not really interested in putting in any money because as you can probably imagine, once any reasonable amount of money goes in, your pair is no longer winning at showdown."

"So this is a board where pocket pairs are very devalued."

### Playing Made Hands

"A Queen is also not really interested in putting in much money. If you think about it, there's not much worse that can call you. Hands that are behind have a difficult time improving, so, nothing more than a small bet."

"King is a tiny bit better than a Queen, but not much. So it could go for one small bet and that's about it."

### Understanding Hand Devaluation

"This board kind of shows you the insane difference and how devalued low pairs can be. Second pair, third pair can be worth very little. Pocket pairs, very little. And also how devalued something like an Ace can be."

"Because what happens here is, how much money can you get with an Ace? Well, the thing about one pair hand like Ace/King/Queen is: Jack Ten is a straight. It's going to come a turn and a river and everyone's going to make a million two pairs, right? Because people play suited Kings and suited Queens and Ace x."

"So even if you have something like a good top pair like Ace Ten, it's a hand that you tread very cautiously with."

### General Strategy

"These kind of three-high-card boards, all your hands are going to be worth less than you think. Of course there are some really strong hands, Jack Ten, three of a kind, top two pair, et cetera."

"But generally speaking, a lot of your hands are going to aim for a small to medium sized pot or just a small pot. And that's true for both players."

## Board Analysis: Deuce Deuce Three

### The Polar Opposite

"On the polar opposite spectrum to that we have Deuce Deuce Three. Deuce Deuce Three, everybody misses everything."

"So now your pocket pairs are worth tons, sometimes three bets. Even your good Ace highs."

### Ace High Value

"So if you have something like Ace Queen on Deuce Deuce Three, that's probably worth two bets."

"It's just this crazy board that people miss so much where when you bet the first time your opponent is going to call you with Ace highs and King highs and maybe Queen highs."

### Educational Contrast

"This is for educational purposes. Of course, we're looking at these polar opposites of when it's three high cards everyone hits a million things, when it's three low cards everyone misses everything."

### Turn Card Impact

"And of course there's going to be context. So on Deuce Deuce Three, if the turn is an Ace, suddenly a lot of our hands slow down. If the turn is a Seven, our Fours and our Fives and our Ace highs can keep betting. If the turn is a Jack, it's something in between."

"So there is a big, big difference as the card gets higher."

### Range Construction Principle

"And if you guys look at the preflop range that we open or the preflop range that we defend, there is always a high card bias in those ranges, so high cards hit this more. The more high cards on the board, the more people hit. The less, the less they hit."

"And that really illustrates the difference between Ace King Queen and Deuce Deuce Three."

### Relative Hand Strength

"It's not important to know exactly how many bets. Because like I said, Deuce Deuce Three, every turn, every river is going to shift things a lot."

"But just recognize how much stronger something like Ace Queen or pocket Fours or even a pair of Threes is here."

"So if it's Deuce Deuce Three and a turn is a Seven, river is an Eight, a pair of Threes is still a strong hand. If the turn is a Jack and the river is a King, a pair of Threes is a lot less strong because people hit those cards more with their ranges."

## Board Analysis: Ten Ten Eight

### A Different Dynamic

"Last board in this video, Ten Ten Eight. Ten Ten Eight is a board which reminds us of Deuce Deuce Three and that it's apparently slightly connected, but all the cards are much higher."

"And this is going to shift things a lot because people hit this board a lot more."

### Trips Frequency

"So whereas on Deuce Deuce Three it's very difficult with this preflop range to have trips, with Ten Ten Eight it's actually very easy to have trips and both players are going to have a lot of trips, so everything shifts again."

### Hand Values

"And while Ace high and pocket pairs are still worth one bet, sometimes two bets, they're very rarely worth three. It's a lot about trips."

"And actually if your opponent check-raises you and bets the turn and bets the river, trips no kicker is not a great hand for you anymore, which is very... Like, on Deuce Deuce Three trips is just the nuts. Best possible hand almost."

"Whereas on Ten Ten Eight, everyone has a lot of trips. So again, we need to be a bit more cautious when a lot of money goes in."

### Specific Hand Guidelines

"Also there are going to be turns and rivers where straights come in. So yeah, Ten Ten Eight, if we kind of go hand by hand, Deuces would want one bet. Ace high would want one bet. Pair of Eights would probably want one and a half bets. Pair of Nines or better probably wants two bets and trips would go for three bets."

### Advanced Range Splitting Concept

"And an interesting thing that happens, say you make your first bet, some opponents will be check-raising you with their trips. And if you're against someone who plays like that, do they raise their good hands? Then suddenly things shift a bit and if you have a pair of Nines, suddenly it's worth three bets because your opponent doesn't have trips anymore."

"So that's a more advanced concept that we'll get to down the line."

"But once we start betting on boards where we expect our opponents to fast play, our hands that might be, in a naive absolute sense, worth two bets against our opponent's range. If your opponent splits his range and you're playing against the weaker part, the part that didn't raise, maybe suddenly it's worth a bit more."
