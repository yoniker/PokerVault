# Live Poker Mission Statement and Philosophy

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Live Play Philosophy

"Hey guys, what's up? So this is going to be the live play portion of the course and I want to start out with kind of a mission statement for live games."

### The Problem with Over-Optimization

"A lot of people when they play online games, they kind of OCD on accuracy. It's like, what's the rake structure? What's the exact plus EV hand? I think that's really generally not my style and it's also not, I think, the correct style for live games."

### The Live Game Environment

"Live games are much more slow-paced than online games. Either you're having fun or you think you have a very big edge, live games tend to be significantly softer and you should have a very big edge."

### Assuming an Edge

"So, whenever I look at anything theory-related for live games, I'm always thinking, whoever I'm coaching, 'he has a huge edge', generally speaking, right? And then you take everything with a grain of salt if you're playing a hand against someone who you think is better than you, but generally speaking, you have a good edge, table is soft."

### The Metagame Value of Being Fun

"There's also this kind of metagame aspect of you want to be having fun, you want people to like you, and that gets you invited into better and better games down the line. So if you were to sit down and play like a nit at your casino, you might grind some low hourly, but your chances of progress are much lower than if you're laughing and having fun and mixing it up."

"People will just invite you to a home game on the weekend because they'll enjoy playing with you. And that home game is possibly going to have no rake and weaker players. And that invite is worth so much."

### The Core Philosophy

"In my eyes, this is to have fun. Live is slow-paced. I'd like to basically say, I want you guys to assume you have an edge and push things in that direction, especially in terms of preflop. We're going to approach things in that way."

### Approach to Rake

"So I'm not going to think too much about rake. I think edge should more than overcome the rake. So it's fine to look at even sims with no rake as a beginning point."

### Playing More Hands

"And I really want to push towards playing more hands and giving more action because I think there are enormous side benefits in live games to playing in that sort of way, and that the edge even justifies it and it should really be plus EV."

### Avoiding the Nit Trap

"So yeah, don't be the guy who's soldiering every hand in preflop charts. We're going to get you guys very accurate ways to play, but they're going to be wide, open-minded, accurate with the goal of letting you guys get in there and play a lot and use your time and not just sit there for an hour and fold ninety percent of your hands because everyone's opening too big."

### The Computer vs Reality Problem

"How are we going to do that? The funny thing is, if you were to put in these big opens into a computer and everyone in modern poker studies with computers, computers would tell you to be very tight and they'd tell you that the guy opening big is opening way too wide and he's losing money."

"And the computer wouldn't necessarily easily give you a reasonable answer for how to play other than just be really, really tight when someone opens big. But we have figured out ways to get around that. I'm going to show you guys these in this path."
