# Deepstacked Play Strategy

## Core Concepts

### Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) Fundamentals

"Hey guys. I want to talk a bit about deepstacked play. Really the key to deepstacked play is to constantly think of stack to pot ratio and how much money your hand wants to put in."

"What I mean is, let's say we're a thousand big blinds deep, but there's eight hundred big blinds in the pot. That's a stack to pot ratio of roughly one, so you're going to get it in very, very wide. Most of the time when you're very deep, it's not easy to get into huge pots."

### Strategic Approaches When Deep

"There are a few types of things I would do when I'm very, very deep. Number one is, whenever I have a strong hand, say something like top pair, top kicker. When I'm very deep and the SPR is huge, I always ask myself, 'do I want to get all the money in or is this more of a pot-controlling hand?'"

### SPR and Hand Strength Relationship

"Now if you raise the five bigs and your opponent calls and you're a hundred deep, the SPR is nine to one, top pair, top kicker is almost going for stacks. But if you're two hundred or three hundred or four hundred deep, it almost certainly isn't. And it's very, very important to realize and recognize this."

### Pot Control Deep

"Once a hand is not going for stacks, number one, it's fine to check it. Completely fine. You're not necessarily going for all of it, so you don't have to put in money on every street. You might go check back flop with top pair, top kicker, or an overpair when you're very deep. You might bet flop, check back turn... You can get a bit tricky with these hands and that helps you to avoid tougher situations."

### Responding to Aggression

"The second thing is... Well, again, you're very deep, you don't have to check-raise these hands, but if you bet them and someone raises you, you kind of tread cautiously. You're always going to call the first raise, but as he starts giving away his intention to go for a ton of money, you have to reevaluate and say, 'well, this is a very strong hand'."

## Hand Example

### Relative Hand Strength Changes with Depth

"Say something like Ace King on a King Eight Three Seven board. That's a very strong hand. But if three hundred big blinds go in, it's a very, very weak hand."

- **Flop (Kh 8d 3s):** Top pair, top kicker (AK) is strong at normal stacks
- **Turn (7h):** Still strong in 100BB pot, but weakens as stacks get deeper

### Reading Opponent Intentions

"Another thing that happens deep is that you need to reevaluate this and constantly pay attention to what your opponent is trying to do. And if he's... tries going for a stack, understand when your hand becomes a bluff-catcher and don't get married to overpairs and top pairs and feel like they're unfoldable."

"Because short stack, they are kind of unfoldable. But as you get deeper, they become actually very frequent folds and not nearly as strong once a lot of money goes in."

### Applying Pressure When Deep

"Another thing that you can do when your very deepstacked by the way, is put a lot of pressure on people. Being very, very deep, if someone gives away that they have a one-pair hand, whether it's through their bet size or their timing or their body language or anything else, you can put an amount of pressure on them where it would be quite the hero call with a one-pair hand."

### Exploiting Predictable Players

"And there are some live players who it's really great to run over in this way. If for example, I know that you always fast play your good hands and you're not comfortable calling for stacks with one-pair hands, I can very often go bet flop, bet big on the turn, two or 3x pot on the river and get almost no calls from you in that situation. Again, depending on the runout."

### Advanced Pressure Tactics

"But it's a nice tool to have in your arsenal when you're very, very deep, to be able to threaten people. So if someone goes half pot flop, half pot turn, you might say, 'oh, you're betting that small. You can't have something very big, raise you huge, shove the river'. So a bit of an advanced play but worth having in your arsenal."

## Key Takeaways

### SPR Guidelines

- **SPR ~1:** Get stacks in very wide
- **SPR ~9 (100BB):** TPTK often goes for stacks
- **SPR 18+ (200BB+):** TPTK becomes pot control hand
- **SPR 27+ (300BB+):** Even strong hands need caution

### Deep Stack Adjustments

- Check back strong hands for pot control
- Mix up lines with TPTK and overpairs
- Don't feel obligated to bet every street
- Recognize when strong hands become bluff-catchers

### Pressure Opportunities

- Exploit players who can't call for stacks with one pair
- Attack small sizing that caps opponent's range
- Use massive overbets when opponents show weakness
- Line: Bet flop → 2-3x pot turn → Shove river

### Key Principles

- Constantly evaluate SPR and adjust strategy
- Don't get married to overpairs/TPTK when deep
- Use stack depth as leverage against uncomfortable opponents
- Tread cautiously when facing aggression with one-pair hands
