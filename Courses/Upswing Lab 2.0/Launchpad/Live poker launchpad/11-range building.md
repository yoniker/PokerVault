Hey guys. So we're going to
stream some poker at The Lodge. This is going to be ten-twenty-five.
It looks like mostly
not-professional players. So I'm
going to stream at 2x, sound off, and we'll talk about what we
recognize about the players and how
we adjust to what they're doing. Okay, we're going to look at every spot
and kind of go through these things.
So, Ace Queen offsuit, limps from
the cutoff. When a player limps, generally speaking, what you want to be doing is thinking
about how wide... First of all,
we categorize them as a
bit of a passive player. I'd assume people who limp are not
big fans of bluffing. And this,
I might be proven wrong on this, but this would be my initial assumption. And you can isolate them wide, but
you can also limp behind kind of wide,
and again, as a baseline, we have the playable hands that we
talked about in the preflop section. Suited connectors, suited Kings,
suited Aces, broadways, pocket pairs,
et cetera. And not necessarily
going wider than that as a default, especially for raising. Calling
behind them you can go a bit wider.
Jack Seven offsuit folds the
button and small blind folds. We're going to take a flop. It looks like
it's a straddled pot or I don't know,
yeah, it looks like it's a
straddle pot. Ten Eight Eight. Poker Momma checks. This guy bets fifty and it's... If we end up seeing a showdown,
it's worth thinking he bet
fifty into seventy-five. So a two-thirds pot with Ace Queen
on Ten Eight Eight. That's kind of
a weird bet. It's not completely clear. Check, check. Now I'd expect Poker
Momma to bluff and we see her checking.
He checks and shows it
down and wins. Again, try to think about the information we got
here. So Poker Momma had an open-ended
straight draw, she called to try to hit,
she didn't hit, did she try bluffing? No. So, if this hand went to showdown,
we immediately categorize her as a
player who doesn't like bluffing. Then, if she does bet in this situation, we
certainly wouldn't look to call Ace Queen.
The player with a Queen, I'm guessing he be flop just because
Ten Eight Eight rainbow Ace Queen looks like a good hand. Then after
that checking down makes sense.
We don't have too much information.
We know he limped with Ace Queen, so we should definitely be hesitant
to isolate his limps too wide
because he's limping strong hands. Okay, let's go for another hand from this
stream and gather some more information. Now, we have a player who raises
3x from the hijack with Fives. Now,
you guys in your games are not always
going to see the whole card so you'll have less information, but this is good practice. Three Deuce
offsuit calls on the button. Now,
if this ever went to show down, we know that this player
is extremely wide preflop. I would say wider than the forty
VPIP. At least that wide, in terms of how you should play
against them. Poker Momma three bets, pocket Queens. Corey's
going to fold King Jack.
We see a call with Fives. Maybe something I should say to you guys
is these hands like Fives and suited
connectors... What should
these do against three bets? The theory would say it's kind of close
and it depends on the size and how much
money you guys have behind.
That's definitely true. So I wouldn't call Fives
if we were shorter stacked. I wouldn't call Fives to a huge three bet.
But there's also the issue
of who's the better player. The way I think about it is if
theory says these hands are close,
then if I feel like the other guy is
better than me and there are going to be guys at the table who you might
think are better than you,
then I'll fold a close decision. And
if I think I'm better than he is, so for example when he checks he's going
to fold too much to my bets or he's
not going to bluff enough or whatever,
if I feel like I have good reads, then I'll definitely call. So I think
you can make kind of clear decisions with
these and hopefully you guys will be able
to call against most opponents but not all of them. Three Deuce should definitely
fold and it does. Okay.
This is a spot where Queens should
sometimes trap and we know it's Poker Momma, right? And Poker Momma we
saw check down before with Jack Nine.
So her squeeze initially we'll assume
is not a bluff because she doesn't seem interested in bluffing. Maybe that's
enough reason to fold the Fives pre.
Now Queen Nine Deuce. Of course maybe she missed with
her Ace King but we know she doesn't love bluffing. So we might make a bet to make her fold
Ace King or multiple bets to make her
fold Jacks. But we're not
going to call any of her bets. So here San decides to
fire with pocket Fives. He's going to get called.
Three and I'd assume this goes check
check now. He was kind of doing an information fire. King on
the river. And if she bets,
you fold even if you have Ace
Queen, even if you have King Five. Because she's not bluffing, right? She goes for an all-in. Easy fold
with Fives, especially against her,
especially if we saw the Jack Nine.
And in terms of how San is playing, he's kind of playing in a
fuck-around-and-find-out way. So,
the type of player we talked
about where when he hits, he bets. Queen Nine Deuce, it checks to him,
he makes a bet. Ten Eight Eight,
it checks to him, he makes
a bet with Ace Queen. So he's the bet-when-you-hit
guy. And whenever he checks, he's probably fairly weak. And
also you should be raising him.
Okay, let's go through some more hands. Here, pocket Sixes raises. Looks like there's maybe a
fifty dollars straddle on. We have Poker Momma calling
with Ace Ten suited and Poker
Traveler looks like making a very loose
peel with Four Deuce and suddenly Ace King off shoving. So I'd
assume everyone just folds.
Looks like Sixes snap called. I'm not really sure what's going on
here. But yeah, we'll go to the next one.
But let's say the Sixes guy likes calling, right? So I'd kind of generalize from this
that he likes catching bluffs and I'd be
more hesitant to bluff him. Yeah, let's find a more postfloppy
hand. King Eight suited. I'm assuming it's going to raise.
Jack Eight offsuit folds. And Alright, one more. Okay, it's going to go post.
Ace Queen offsuit raises, probably with multiple straddles, and
Jack Four suited defends the straddle.
Now we have King Seven Eight monotone. And remember I told you guys the leak
many live players have is when they're out
of position as the raiser they
check too weak? Here Ace Queen checks. With Jack Four, if you
missed, you should definitely bluff,
even if you have Jack Four of hearts.
You would've gotten a fold. But here... let's see what actually
happens. Check, check.
So Jack Four decides to
slow play. If we know this, we definitely want to pay attention. Poker Traveler fires seventy-five
with Ace Queen offsuit.
Again, it's a kind of weird bet, I don't think it accomplishes
very much for his hand. He's going to get
called, so still slow playing
the Jack Four. This guy... Again, we'd kind of say like "oh,
he raises", sure. But yeah,
you can see how the bet size was
very indicative of the hand strength. So we might say about the guy with
Ace Queen that he bets his hand
strength. I bet you guys if he had
something stronger it would've bet bigger, so it's worth looking to
raise his big bets. This is
actually... Yeah, let's
stop and go to the next one. Okay, next hand. Six
Seven of hearts raises, Ace Six suited calls the
cutoff. Totally fine.
So far Seven Four suited in the
small blind is way too loose. This is not in the category group
of hands we said we'd be playing.
Definitely not with players left to act. And if you guys remember about multiway, multiway bluffing is a lot less effective.
Don't feel obligated to
fire a continuation bet or
anything of the sort because people tend to call a bit
too much. So, San checks,
Poker Momma we're sure will check because
she doesn't love bluffing and Corey checks his Ace Six, which makes
sense, it's not too strong there. Now,
you guys see Poker Momma firing
the turn for two twenty-five, she turned the combo draw, a gutshot flush draw.
And if I were Corey here with Ace Six,
I would snap fold with the information
we have because I don't think she's bluffing. If you guys think
about it, she isn't bluffing,
she has a monster draw and against her
range of strong hands and monster draws Ace Six is a very clear fold.
Maybe this is something I
should say clearly to you guys, if someone against you either
has a big draw or a strong hand,
your weak top pair better get folded
soon unless all the money's in already and there's not much behind, because really there's nothing good that
can happen unless you are good at soul
reading rivers. So yeah, I would actually fold Ace Six
here and even seeing the showdown, I would still fold against
what's probably her range.
Seven Four of course folds. The nice thing is she's
going to give up the river, or at least we would expect based
on the information we have so far.
Let's see if that's actually
true. There you go. Again, had she bet the river, why
do we do with Ace Six? Fold.
And maybe with this extra information
you can call kind of knowing that you have a safe fold on the river so
you're never going to put in money bad.
But yeah, you guys can see how
quickly we picked up this information. Of course we see her hole cards, but you guys are often going to see
people's hole cards and how efficiently it
leads you to good decisions about
situations and how much of an edge it can generate to basically fold if
she bets the river here, right?
We know she's not bluffing. Okay, let's do a few more about these players. This looks like a BvB hand. So Ace
Nine suited raises, King Jack call. Oh,
King Jack offsuit actually three bets, so I'm assuming Ace Nine is going to call. Let's see the flop and we'll
talk about common exploit.
Number one, I think as we're
the aggressor in position, we'd expect the other player
to fold, generally speaking, a bit too much to the first bet
and definitely too much to the
second bet, especially if it's big. Now, in three bet pots you
can't really overbet, but generally put your stack and you
can expect the other player to fold too
much. So we see a check. King Jack here should recognize
it's not necessarily going for stacks, so it can bet or check.
If they were a bit shorter it would be more of an
always-bet situation. Ace Nine calls. Ten on the turn.
Ace Nine checks. King Jack, again,
not necessarily going for stacks,
so it's fine to check it back. Also fine to bet. And if you bet, check back the river,
right?, with King Jack.
He does bet and now I'd expect
Ace Nine... Oh, he bets all-in! I'd say this is a mistake,
overplaying the King Jack.
It would put me in a very tough spot
if I had something like King Queen. But again, let's talk about conclusions.
Say we know this guy is doing this
and what he's doing is basically he's overplaying his hands a bit.
What do we do against that?
A very common adjustment
is we just overplay the top of our range. So, against
most live players, what you want to be doing is
the top parts of your range,
top pair, top kicker;
overpairs, hands like that, you don't fold them and you kind of
close your eyes and put too much money in
with them. That would fit for a situation like
this where if you have King Queen or Ace King and you might be thinking, "oh,
do I only beat bluffs?" or
"what's going on?" You say "no, I just overplay the top of my
range, this is fine." So yeah,
Ace Nine has a very easy fold here. Keep going to the next one. Okay, next hand... Let's
actually scoot a bit back,
let's just go to another
hand kind of quickly. Queen Jack suited raises from the hijack, Tens three bets from
the cutoff to two fifty,
Ace Six suited here should fold. You get a worse price called calling
a three bet than calling a three bet
because you don't have the raise money
put in and there's a player behind. These kind of calls which live players
tend to make with pocket pairs and nice
suited hands, and generally the
type of hands that are okay to play, the fact that there's a player behind
you who sometimes wakes up with Aces and
also just that there's no money invested, so the price is more expensive to enter, I would say makes these cold calling
of three bets a play you should
generally avoid. So yeah. Now,
if people respect initiative, everyone checks to the player with
Tens. Ace Six of diamonds checks, Queen Jack of clubs checks and Tens
is going to fire a small bet and
probably everyone folds. Now, there's not too much to take away but
what you can take away is the fact that
Ace Six of diamonds cold called the
three bet and this is the same guy who stacked off with Sixes before.
So like we said, not a folder,
not preflop, not postflop. This isn't a guy who you want to
three bet with Six Seven suited, rather you want to three bet
him with Ace Jack suited.
Because you'll be three betting Six Seven
and he'll be calling you with Ace Six and King Six. We're going to keep
going with this group of players. I
think of each of these guys
as an archetype of player,
not the specific person. We have Fours raising, Ten Nine suited
re-raising, or is just going to call?
Again this is a call which
you don't really have to make. If you feel like the other guy's
going to outplay you, feel free to fold.
But of course, other way around, there's
plenty behind and it's not very big. So this is fine. And we
get an Ace Queen Eight,
two-tone board. Check.
Ten Nine going to bet. This is kind of a good runout, bad runout. When you raise and you
get a high-card board,
generally you start out betting and it's
difficult for the other player to call enough. And kind of standardly
played. There's not much information,
but what we can look at is the size. There was six twenty, the guy bet two fifty into six twenty.
We can piece this together with
the sizes that he bet before if we know his hands.
With Ace Queen, he bet fifty I think into
seventy-five, for two thirds pot. This is a smaller bet and
he is indeed, in a way, with a weaker hand. So we kind of file
this away. We don't know what he has.
Even if you didn't see his cards, you're
like, "oh, Ace Queen Eight, two-tone. You bet kind of small there. It's a connected dynamic
board." You should be like,
"do you always bet small with everything
or is this actually indicated that you're a bit weak?" We're going
to keep paying attention to that.
Ace King offsuit limps, comes
up Jack Nine Nine. Check, check. Ace King makes sense to check, Ten Five actually could have bet
on the turn given an open ender.
Now he does choose to bet the
river and Ace King folds. Again, pay attention to the sizings. Fifty
into one twenty-five. But yeah,
nothing too special there. Here, Eight Four suited on the button raises. Ace
King suited traps from the small blind. You should generally re-raise,
you need a good reason to trap.
We're four-way to the flop. Let's see anything
interesting happens so far. Basically, everyone checks to the guy
with Eight Four. He has a gutshot.
You guys remember how we were
wandering about his sizings and what they mean. Here the pot is four thirty-five, again he bets kind of
small. Not that that's a mistake,
but if you've ever seen him bet bigger
it makes more sense this is weak. Ace King decides to check-raise and King
Jack of hearts actually decides to go
all-in. Now, King Jack of hearts going all-in
against the check-raise I would not recommend. I think
that's fairly optimistic. Here Ace King snap calls. And this is...
What are you really beating with
Ace King? Just a flush draw. It's not a very easy call, but it looks like these players
know each other well enough.
But certainly once you
slow play Ace King preflop, you're probably not looking to fold. I would've had a tough decision versus
this and I wouldn't be sure I'm good.
