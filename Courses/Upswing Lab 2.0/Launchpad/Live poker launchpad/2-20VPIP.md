# Preflop Strategy Against 5BB Opens in Live Poker

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Live Preflop Challenges

"So I want to start with preflop. Like I said, preflop is a bit difficult because the live environment is so different than anything computer generated and a lot of guys don't have a point of reference. And as far as I know, as I'm making this, this is the first place that you will actually get to see something like this."

### Simulation Parameters

"This is an eight handed simulation we're two hundred deep, rake free, and I think rake free is correct because you should have a big edge and you should be making your decisions based on is the guy a really good player or a really bad player."

"Here we're looking at the five-BB-sized open-raise. And the guy should be a worse player than you guys, hopefully, because guys who raised to this size are very unstudied. It's a very non-optimal raise size, in theory. And yeah, you should have an edge. So we're looking at this rake-free."

### The Opponent's Range

"What I did here is I forced under the gun player to raise this range, twenty-three percent of hands, to five big blinds. And this is meant to show a common player type in live, who's... He's somewhat trying, he's not playing every hand, but he's kind of wide and he's opening big as the size."

### Conceptualizing Big Opens

"First of all, by opening to five big blinds, what people are kind of saying, say they open to fifty dollars in a five-ten game, they're saying 'we're not playing five-ten, dude, we're playing ten-twenty. I'm opening to fifty. It's a regular size.' So one way to conceptualize this would be to say everyone's playing this like a ten-twenty game."

"We're actually roughly a hundred deep in the ten-twenty game. This is a two... Everyone here has two thousand blinds. But if we treat it as twice the blind size, we'd say we're a hundred deep. It's a ten-twenty game."

"There's this kind of unspoken agreement in live games often where, for some reason, sometimes it's based around some of the guys at the table, they're playing it as though the blinds are higher and you can join in or not join in as much as you want."

### Position-Based Adjustments

"First off, we're seeing it's kind of a tight reaction or reacting with a tighter range when the guy open, or folding hands like Ace Queen offsuit and Sixes, and he's having fun opening like Six Four suited under the gun, or King Five suited."

"It's kind of weird, but the thing is you have the entire table behind you and he might not respect that, but you guys do need to respect that. Even though we want to have fun, having the entire table behind us severely limits our ability to put in money with hands because we're just going to get squeezed a lot."

### The Impact of Players Behind

"Just by virtue of if you think about it, six people left, how often is one of them going to have the top five percent hand? More often than we'd like, right? When there are six. The less people there are left, the wider we can continue."

"So I'll show you guys this. If this is with six people left, we continue seven percent of hands. With five people left, bumps up to eight and a half. With four people left, it bumps up to ten. Against the same range."

"And then it bumps up to eleven and a half. And on the button it bumps up to thirteen and a half. And still there are two people behind."

### Position Doesn't Matter for the Opener

"Okay, first of all you guys might say, 'well, what if he opens from a different position?' And the nice thing about this is... I'm looking at their range. So even if someone opens this from MP and you're in the cutoff, this response is still correct, right? Because it's the same range."

"I'm not actually locking in the opener's position, just his range, just how do you play versus a 5x open from this kind of range based on your position, not based on their position, they just have the range."

### Flexibility Between Calling and 3-Betting

"First of all, generally speaking, when we look at calling and re-raising ranges, most hands are kind of okay to do either one with. So you guys will see Aces always raise, Kings will sometimes raise, sometimes call. Queen, sometimes. Jack, sometimes. Eight, sometimes. Seven, sometimes. But Tens only call."

"But if we look at the EVs, these numbers, o point three eight versus o point three four, and this sim is not like NASA-accuracy-sender-off-to-the-moon level, they're close enough. So all of these hands, anything you can call you can also raise. Anything you can raise, you can also call. With the exception of Aces, usually what you just want to raise."

"So basically, when I look at this range that continues, I'm thinking 'this is the range that continues and any of these hands I can either re-raise or call'. And it's just kind of up to me based on a million soft factors at the table, who the guy is? What you're more comfortable playing? Just whatever you want."

### Thinking in Hand Categories

"Second off, I think of this as hand types. While this will give you kind of a stop, right? We go up to Queen Jack suited, but no Jack Ten, we have Six Five but not Six Seven. It has these kind of stops. I think of hands in more broad categories because, generally speaking, this program has to have you not playing too many hands because if you play too many hands, the rest of the table can adjust and squeeze you wide."

"So if I thought that the table is not going to adjust and squeeze me wide, there is... Generally just not going to squeeze me wide, then when I see Five Six, I'm seeing Five Six, Five Four, Six Seven."

### Expanding Beyond Solver Recommendations

"I mean if King Queen is in there, surely Ace Queen can be in there. If Queen Jack suited can be in there, Jack Ten suited can be in there, Ten Nine suited can be in there. Presumably, right?"

"If I can go Ace Five, Ace Four, I can go Ace Three, Ace Deuce. If I can go King Jack, Queen Jack, Jack Ten, if I can go Sevens plus, I can probably go Fives plus."

"If Six Five is in there, then Four Five and Six Seven, we can put all of these in there. Even though they're not the same but, close enough. So I'd be saying these are kind of the hands I would consider playing."

### Table-Based Adjustments

"And then the way I would treat this is I'd say 'if I have a read on this guy or if the table is kind of weak, passive, they're not going to squeeze very much.' Main thing that's bad for these hands is getting squeezed, because then you might call the squeeze, but your equity in the pot, your EV, diminishes drastically and it goes very quickly down to around zero."

"So, as long as the table is not squeezing very much and people are playing a bit tight, where they might say, 'oh, UTG open and you called, I'm going to be careful just going to call my tens and Jacks, I'm just going to call my Ace Queen and they re-raise fairly nitty', or there are just bad players behind, all of these hands are playable and they're playable either as a re-raise or as a call, both."

## Key Takeaways

### General Response Range vs 5BB Opens (23% opening range)

"So this is kind of how I'm treating this. And I think, as a general rule of thumb, what we're saying is when this guy who opens twenty-three percent of hands opens, we can play pocket pairs, suited connectors, the better suited Aces, so not Ace Six, Ace Seven, Ace Eight necessarily. But let's say suited Aces, suited Broadways, King Queen off, Ace Queen off. That's our general range."

### Position-Based Continuation Percentages

- 6 players behind: 7% of hands
- 5 players behind: 8.5% of hands
- 4 players behind: 10% of hands
- 3 players behind: 11.5% of hands
- Button (2 behind): 13.5% of hands
- Small blind: 9% of hands
- Big blind: 12% of hands

### Key Strategic Principles

"The more people behind us, we're going to be a bit tighter. The less people behind us a bit looser. Any hand can three bet or call. But you have your general response and I think that's the good and important baseline, the having a good place to start for playing the situation preflop."

### Flexibility Over Memorization

- Most hands can either call or 3-bet profitably
- Decision based on table dynamics and player reads
- Think in hand categories rather than exact combinations
- Adjust based on squeeze frequency at the table
