My summary: People in live suck, my goal is to make at least 20BB/100, assume everyone is bad until proven otherwise, my job is to pick tells on them, like timing tells, sizing tells, physical tells, their range, how are they unbalanced etc and exploit the fk out of them
# Goals and Mindset for Live Poker Success

## Core Concepts

### The Win Rate Target

"I want to talk about the goal I want you guys to have in live games. The goal in my eyes is to be a twenty BB per a hundred plus winner, which means basically you're crushing the table that you're playing at."

"I think really this is the only way to go in live. I think any kind of aiming for a low win rate is just going to be a huge grind and you're better off just getting a job."

### Why High Win Rates Are Achievable

"And really these win rates are very, very possible, because the guys you're playing with are not very good."

### The Fundamental Approach

"So the approach I would advise you guys to have is whenever you look at someone, you say to yourself, 'this guy is terrible at poker, and it's up to me to figure out how and to exploit him.'"

### Dealing with Strong Players

"And if there happen to be one or two guys who are very good at poker at your table, you play them differently. You stay out of their way more until you feel comfortable against them, but they're not where your win rate is going to come from either way, even if you might get better than them."

### Where Win Rate Comes From

"Win rate in live games comes from the weaker, less experienced players. So rather than aim to be balanced and aim to get the correct size and aim to not overbluff, I would strongly advise you guys to constantly focus on the other guy."

### The Problem with Hiding

"And maybe a good example I can give is advice I got about live tells. When I started playing live, the advice I got was try to not talk during hands, don't look too much, like find a place at the table and stare at it and kind of hide."

"The issue with hiding is that if I'm hiding and I'm staring at the table, sure it's tougher for you to pick up information about me, but there are still some information there, but it's definitely impossible for me to pick up information about you."

### The Active Information Gathering Approach

"And so I want you guys to start out assuming everyone around you has physical tells, everyone around you has sizing tells, and timing tells. And they're terribly unbalanced in every spot and it's up to you to figure out how and why."

### Coming Next

"In the next few videos, I'm going to show you guys a few examples about what mistakes people might make and what you can do about them."

## Key Takeaways

### Target Win Rate
