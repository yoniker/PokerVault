## Introduction

**Uri:** "Okay, so hey Eyal."

**Eyal:** "Hey, what's up?"

**Uri:** "We're now recording and... Hey Eyal, I'll introduce you and you can correct me. You used to be a pro player a long time ago before all of the solvers and computer programs and modern stuff around today, and then you went, had a... got a real job, did some high level programming and now you're kind of back and you have kind of old school knowledge. You're not familiar with any of the new things going on, overbets, block bets, calling three bets out of position. Everything's a bit different than it used to be, but you still have good poker fundamentals, like how good is your hand, three bet the weaker players a lot and make good hands and put in money, stuff like that."

**Eyal:** "I hope so."

**Uri:** "Yeah. Okay, cool. So we'll start hitting play. This site is a very soft site, so it's similar to a live environment a bit. A lot of the guys playing here are actually playing on their phone and are primarily live players. So yeah, we'll start hitting play and I'll talk you through anything interesting that happens. We can unmute this and we'll kind of skip ahead to..."

## Hand 1: K♣4♣ - Small Blind vs Big Blind

- **Preflop:** Eyal raises to 3BB from SB, BB calls
- **Flop (J♥8♣5♣):** Eyal bets 3BB into 6BB pot, BB calls
- **Turn (T♥):** Eyal bets 10BB into 12BB pot, BB calls
- **River (Q♦):** Eyal checks, BB checks back

**Uri:** "Okay, so here you have King Four of clubs, you raise in the small blind and you start out betting half pot here, which is fine. Generally speaking, if we go and say we're either going with a small-bet strategy or a big-bet strategy, if you want to bet everything here, you would go more like two big blinds and if you want to bet a polarized range, I think three is a bit too small, right? If you go three, it's kind of an in-between size. For three blinds, you could just bet an Eight. So, I think just to keep things simple, I'd say either bet two and bet very wide or bet like four and a half, five, and bet more narrow. Does that make sense? It's not very important just to keep it simple in your head because three is, it's just in-between betting everything and betting good hands on a board like this."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I suppose I assume it was kind of not wet enough. Yeah, I guess."

**Uri:** "Cool. Okay, so we have Ten of hearts. You have a flush draw out of position. This seems fine. And what makes you give up the river there?"

**Eyal:** "The board's connected and he just called me twice so I maybe assumed that most of his range was... if it wasn't improved by the time when the Queen drastically improved it, I rather assumed that he wasn't going to fold. If I bet a healthy twenty-seven, let's say, on the river, I just thought he's not going to fold enough... he might even raise me. I mean, with the hands he has here."

**Uri:** "So I'll give you a bit of a different way to think about it. First of all, as a rule of thumb, when your flush draw misses, it's good to give up with a busted flush draw because... if you think of his range as what is he calling, what is he folding? One of the main hands he's folding is two clubs, right? King Deuce of clubs, King Three of clubs, King Six of clubs, King Seven of clubs, all of those get to the river and fold. So having the King of clubs is quite bad for you. It actually affects his calling frequency by maybe three, four percent. Four of clubs is less bad, but still. Ace Four of clubs, Six Four of clubs, right? There are a bunch of hands that fold with a Four of clubs and not so many hands that call. In terms of the board connecting, if we kind of zoom out... like we said, what's his range? He should have every combo of Six Seven and those are going to fold. He should have Five x of hearts, Ace Five of hearts, King Five of hearts, Five Six of hearts, Five Seven of hearts, the same with Eight x of hearts. All of those hands get to the river and fold, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah, but should fold those on the turn?"

**Uri:** "No, because they're a pair and a flush draw because there are two hearts."

**Eyal:** "Okay."

**Uri:** "Makes sense?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I guess."

**Uri:** "Right? You don't fold Five Six of hearts to a turn bet on this board. Another thing is he could have a Jack. Generally speaking, all his Jacks should get to the river and this is a very scary river for a lot of his Jacks. If he has Ace Jack, King Jack, Jack Seven suited, Jack Six suited, Jack Four suited, all of those hands are probably fairly worried about this river. Would you agree?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So what I want to do is I want to kind of expand the way that you think about his range here and the rule of thumb I generally use, you see how there are so many hands you could have, right? The reason for that is it's blind versus blind. It's a very wide range spot. Wide range spots are very tough to call enough on because you have so many hands, right? If this were under the gun versus big blind and I asked you how many hands can you have? The answer is not that many. He can't have half the hands I listed. Six Seven is only suited. Maybe you don't even play it. There's no Jack Seven, Six. Everything gets a lot narrower. But blind versus blind generally or default should be to follow through on bluffs because the ranges are wide and the fact that stuff came in kind of goes two ways. So if he had Eight Nine, Ten Nine, Jack Nine, he has a straight, but there are a lot of other hands that fold. So I think this is a reasonable spot to bluff. It's not the best in the world, but it is perfectly fine to bluff and he's going to have a hard time with many hands."

**Eyal:** "Okay, Cool."

## Hand 2: Q♥8♥ - Flopped Straight

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens to 3BB from BU, SB calls
- **Flop (T♠9♦J♥):** Eyal bets 5.2BB into 7BB pot, SB folds

**Uri:** "There he bets. So let's move to the next one. Here you have Queen Eight of hearts, you flopped a straight and you go big bet, which is fine. Just make sure, and we'll watch in the video to make sure you're not doing this, that you don't go big bet with good hands and small bet with bad hands."

**Eyal:** "I know, it's because the board is connected so..."

## Donk Betting Discussion

**Uri:** "Okay, here Ace Eight. This guy leads out half pot and you fold. I guess what I had to ask you is, what do you take away from him leading out half pot? How do you adjust to this in the future?"

**Eyal:** "I generally just write a note about him that he makes donk bets. What I do is I write a note that says 'donks for value' with a question mark. And then whenever I actually see a hand, I remove a question mark and figure he donks for value."

**Uri:** "And then if you have the 'donks for value' note, how do you use that when you play against this guy?"

**Eyal:** "When he checks I bet. I will bet all my value hands... All my bluffs."

**Uri:** "Yeah, you treat his checks as weak. Perfect. Okay, so keep going. I love that you can skip ahead with a right click button."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, it is kind of convenient."

## Hand 3: Pocket Queens - Multiway

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens to 3BB from CO, BB calls
- **Flop (6♠9♠4♥):** BB checks, Eyal bets 4.8BB into 6.5BB pot, BB calls
- **Turn (A♣):** Check/check
- **River (K♣):** Check/check

**Uri:** "Cool. So you open Queens, this guy calls, we get Four Six Nine. I will say on the left..."

**Eyal:** "No, no, I would never call him, but I had to."

**Uri:** "Oh, the VPIP. Okay. So generally these high VPIP tables, the best way to reach a high VPIP is to limp a lot to make it bigger. It's just a cheaper way than doing this."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Whatever you do is losing you money, but I'd rather limp like a King Six suited than have to be in this spot where you're just on the verge of getting kicked from the table and here maybe you have an even worse hand than Deuces and you're forced to call to stay on the table."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Perfect. Okay, so Queens, Four Six Nine, you go with a big bet, which like I said, this is the same board as Jack Eight Five. Jack Eight Five you went with a medium bet, so just make sure it's not hand dependent. Now, the interesting thing about the Ace is that when you go for a big bet, he actually has to fold a lot of his Ace highs. So one of the benefits of the big bet on this kind of board is that it makes it so that when an overcard comes, you get to keep barreling. Does that make sense? So yeah, go ahead."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I guess. Some of them not, but..."

**Uri:** "Yeah, not all of them, but had you gone small bet, he would call you with maybe Ace Ten with a spade, Ace Seven of hearts, even Ace of spades Five, all these hands. When you go big bet a lot of those hands fold, so on the Ace, you actually are supposed to keep being somewhat aggressive. And here either way he checks to you and he checks the river. And I would say, in my eyes, you have the best hand extremely often."

**Eyal:** "I do, yes."

**Uri:** "Because it's hard for him to have a King... It's hard for him to have an Ace and he'd probably lead it out and it's very easy for him to have a Nine, Six or Four. So I definitely consider just betting and when you play very tough opponents, they're very tricky with their checking range. But if you kind of look here... First of all, this is not tough opponents and these guys are not tricky, but I want you to pay attention to the timing... four, five, six. Okay, So nothing special with the timing. But yeah, I think you should at least consider betting there and it's probably a good bet against a lot of these guys."

**Eyal:** "What would the timing tell me?"

**Uri:** "Well, if he would snap check to you, very often that means he didn't even consider betting and then you can put him even more certainly on a weak range. The longer he takes, he might've considered something. So it gets a bit tougher to read into."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

## Hand 4: Pocket Deuces - Made Boat 5-Way

- **Preflop:** LJ opens to 3.5BB, Eyal calls from HJ, BU calls, SB calls, BB calls
- **Flop (J♠Q♥Q♣):** Checks around
- **Turn (8♥):** Checks around
- **River (2♥):** Eyal bets 9.4BB into 17.5BB, BU calls with 8♣6♦, SB calls with 7♥3♥ (flush)

**Uri:** "So here Deuces, we're five-way. Everyone checks around, everyone checks around and you make a boat on the river. How much would you like to bet here?"

**Eyal:** "Well, I mean since... I probably made a mistake here, I thought 'no one has anything, but if I bet half a pot, someone might call me with an Ace high'."

**Uri:** "I don't think anyone calls you with Ace high five-way."

**Eyal:** "The purple is for fish..."

**Uri:** "No, just because it's five-ways. The way I would think of this is very likely..."

**Eyal:** "Maybe Fives..."

**Uri:** "but the main hand calling you is a flush and it's very easy for someone to have a flush. Yeah, a flush and a flush is going to pay you quite a lot. I think a flush calling you is much more likely than any other hand. If you wanted Fives or Ace high to call, I'd bet two big blinds. But I think when you bet half pot, it's kind of tough for people to call you with a weak hand. So I feel like this size is, it's too big and too small. Versus recreational players I'd actually like to just overbet here because they'll call any size with a flush. But if you're betting small, I would go smaller, personally. But yeah, let's see what they end up calling you."

"So this guy called you with an Eight, which is fantastic for your size. This guy just called... I mean I think actually this is okay because the first three guys checking they likely don't have a flush, right? So they're all weak and then it's like we don't expect them to check a flush. Yeah, maybe a bit smaller, but I agree it shouldn't be big. Okay, so well played."

## Hand 5: A♠Q♦ - Four-Way

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens A♠Q♦ to 3.5BB, CO calls, SB calls, BB calls
- **Flop (K♠3♠J♥):** Checks around
- **Turn (T♦):** Eyal bets 11BB into 13.4BB pot, all fold (CO showed a King before folding)

**Uri:** "Okay, here Ace Queen goes four-way... Oh, you're making good turns and rivers so far."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, everything for the content."

**Uri:** "Perfect. Here you bet really big. I guess if we think of this like before, the first two guys are unlikely to be strong and this guy didn't bet on the button, so everyone's likely very weak. So you could maybe think of sizing a bit smaller, right? Similar to what you were saying before. I think that's reasonable. These multiway pots, weak players are often very face up, their checks are weak and no one has anything when they keep checking."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. I get what you're saying."

## VPIP Discussion and Pocket Fours

**Uri:** "Well, you should find opportunities to limp, yeah, because this is costing you more money. You shouldn't be at thirty-two VPIP, you should be at forty already. You should plan this in advance. We'll see if you get opportunities to do it. And I would say this is the same at live games... You want to have high VPIP to get invited again. So yeah, let's see if this Five Deuce suited... No, you had to fold."

**Eyal:** "I wanted the small one, this one here, the Bvenbaum guy. I thought I was favorite but I was out of position... I should have probably just three bet anyway."

**Uri:** "Yeah, I think so. It's not a huge deal but I would prefer to three bet. Cool. Let's see if they let... No. See, you shouldn't open fold Queen Four suited because if it's folded to you, you can min raise or limp and get your VPIP up."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. And that's a much nicer way than having to cold call Ace Seven offsuit in the small blind there."

**Uri:** "So you're missing these ones... I mean this is good enough to open from the cutoff. Let's say you had a Ten Three suited, you could limp and that's a much better play than cold calling the Ace Seven for three. Just the less people there are the less money you have to put in all these things."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. And is this... that's the only table with a VPIP requirement, so it's a bit tough to keep track."

"Fours is okay. You can also just three bet the Fours if you want, just so you know it's fine to three bet these hands. I don't really like three betting low pocket pairs because they're kind hard to maneuver."

**Uri:** "Oh, they're very easy to maneuver. You just start with a small bet and then if the board has multiple high cards, you just put all the money in and pretend you have air. And if it's a low board you try to get to showdown. Sometimes you'll have a set. So imagine the board comes Ace King Six and you have Fours, great hand to bluff with, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "And imagine the board comes Seven Five Deuce, you bet once and then check down."

**Eyal:** "You mean like a small bet or polarized?"

**Uri:** "No, it would have to be a small bet. If you go a big bet then you just check it back and try to show down. But yeah, just like any spot, you just kind of aim for the pot size that's appropriate for your hand and if the hand is worth nothing, then you can turn it into a bluff if you want."

**Eyal:** "Can I switch between the big-bet, small-bet strategies or do I need to stick to one?"

**Uri:** "No, I mean, in theory you go a different one for each board. Some boards... The bet... It's like a democracy. So, some of your hands want the big-bet strategy and some of them want the small bet. Then, depending on the board, the board and your range, determine which one is better. But what I like to recommend to people is just start out by studying one of the strategies in depth so you kind of know what you're doing and then do just that one. And once you have time, study the other one and then you can pick and choose when you use which one. For you, because you're not familiar with the small-bet strat, maybe avoid it until you study it a bit."

"Yeah, that's a good fold with the Ace Deuce."

## Hand 6: Pocket Aces - Multiway with Discussion

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens A♠A♣ to 3BB from LJ, BU calls, SB calls, BB calls
- **Flop (T♥4♠J♥):** Eyal bets 9.9BB into 13.2BB pot, BU calls, SB and BB fold
- **Turn (8♠):** Eyal bets 24.7BB into 33BB pot, BU snap calls
- **River (T♦):** Check/check, BU shows J♦3♦

**Uri:** "So Aces four-way, this is something I think I discuss in the course. When it's multiway you have to size down your bets in theory, because these three guys together are defending against your bet and so against the big bet their range gets narrow very, very quickly. Imagine each of them has a hundred combos. Together, they need to defend like forty combos, so that's thirteen each and their range a bit just gets strong too fast. So multiway we tend to start with very small bets unless there's a huge whale in the hand and then we don't care. And you can say these guys are all whales if you want and then just bet big. I wouldn't argue with you, I don't know these guys. But in theory the bet size here should be something like three big blinds or four big blinds."

**Eyal:** "Oh really?"

**Uri:** "Yeah, yeah. Because there are so many people. Once you go big, you kind of narrow their ranges to a point where you almost can't bet Aces even."

**Eyal:** "When you say narrow down, like to half the pot or something?"

**Uri:** "Yeah, something between third, quarter pot, and half pot. Yeah, half pot is okay too."

**Eyal:** "Okay."

**Uri:** "Perfect. So we get the Eight of spades. This should... Why is it a bad card? What does it improve from him?"

**Eyal:** "A bad card. I mean, obviously Queen Nine just hit, whatever. But I guess if he had a Ten Nine or..."

**Uri:** "That's right!"

**Eyal:** "Jack Nine then..."

**Uri:** "Yeah, well, his equity improved. It is a good card for his range, but he doesn't improve to many hands that beat your hand. If you think about it, Nine Seven suited, if he even has it, he would fold flop because you bet so big and there are two people behind him. So Queen Nine suited improved, that should also have folded but maybe he has it. And then even if he has it, Queen Nine of hearts is a combo draw. So maybe you see a raise earlier. So it's not that many hands. So your Aces are actually still very much ahead. The difficulty with the Eight is a lot of his hands will have very high equity versus your Aces, right? Like you said, Ten Nine, Jack Nine even Queen Jack or anything with a flush draw, a lot of his hands have twenty-five to thirty percent equity. And some people, due to that, just go with really huge bets on the turn. So you could go like bet twice the pot, forcing him to a tough decision whether it's Ten Nine or Queen Jack or whatever."

**Eyal:** "I want him to call me or not?"

**Uri:** "Well it depends how big you bet, right?"

**Eyal:** "Wouldn't it be better to just make it here twenty-seven or..."

**Uri:** "The issue is, let's say you go twenty-five and the river is going to come either a Seven, a Nine, a Queen, a King, a Jack, a heart or a spade. You have a very difficult time playing the river, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So, if we were to kind of count those, so we said... Let's do this quickly. We say bad cards for you would be Seven, Nine, Queen, King, Jack, spade and heart, right?"

**Eyal:** "And why King?"

**Uri:** "King because I think enough hands get there, King Jack, King Ten, that you can't value bet anymore. And then it's a bit awkward. You just check and hope he doesn't bet."

**Eyal:** "Okay."

**Uri:** "Maybe a King is okay. Yeah, let's say no King. So just these."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So spade, there are eight spades because you have the Ace of spades. There are nine hearts. And then Sevens other than spade and heart, this would be two, this would be two, this would be two and this would be three... nine, eighteen. So there are twenty-six bad turn cards."

**Eyal:** "Just two Jacks actually, no?"

**Uri:** "Sure. Two Jacks. Yeah, twenty-five bad turn cards... Bad river cards, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "That's a lot of bad river cards. So even though you want them to call, you're not sure you want them to call because you're going to have a hard time on so many rivers. Another option you could have is you could actually just check your hand. And see that you get the good half of the deck before putting more money in. And then if he bets, you can just check-shove, for example. But yeah, it's just a way to think about it. Here we bet, I'd really be hoping he folds... Ten of diamonds is actually one of the nicer rivers for you, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah, yeah, I guess... I mean, I was checking with the intention of going in."

**Uri:** "I think that's fine. You could also just bet and say like all the draws missed, he's probably going to call you. The main thing is to understand that because you made a big flop bet four-way, he shouldn't have many Tens. So yeah, the Ten almost doesn't matter. I hope I didn't lose to Ten there. Yeah. I think with all the draws missing maybe bet, but yeah, it's fine. And you can see that your big bet on the flop was actually perfect in this kind of environment. If he's calling Jack Three of diamonds twice, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah. I mean you'll probably, you're saying there're more Jack x in his hands than missed flush draws and straight draws and whatever that would try to bluff me on the river."

**Uri:** "He's not guaranteed to try to bluff you. A lot of these weaker players just check down when they miss. But this does bring me back to a really important rule in playing in these games, which is that when you're playing against weaker guys, you want to overplay your good hands, put in too much money with them, which is kind of what you did here on the flop. And I was telling you in theory don't do this if the players are good, but as the players get worse this is actually a great play to just flop a good hand and put tons of money in with it and not worry too much."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Okay, so let's wait for the next one... I guess you're going to play Aces?"

**Eyal:** "I have to. I'm getting close to thirty percent."

## Identifying the Whale and Ace Jack Squeeze

**Uri:** "Ah, I see, I see. Perfect. This is a cool spot because the SPR, the stack to pot ratio is very low. There is forty-eight and he has seventy. So this is a spot where you can actually bet even smaller than third pot, you could bet something like eight or nine big blinds."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I immediately regretted betting so big."

**Uri:** "Yeah, this is actually a big bet considering the amount of money you guys have and then turn, you either shove or bet small. Again, I think when the board connects like this, so a lot of his stuff has a gutshot with it, it makes sense to shove like you did. Because he could have an Eight Seven or a Nine Ten or a Queen Ten, all those hands."

## Hand 7: A♣J♠ - Squeeze and Bluffed by Whale

- **Preflop:** LJ (90 VPIP) opens to 3.5BB, HJ calls, Eyal squeezes to 15BB from SB with A♣J♠, LJ calls
- **Flop (5♦2♦5♥):** Check/check
- **Turn (Q♣):** Eyal bets 11.5BB, LJ shoves for 130BB, Eyal folds, LJ shows 9♦7♣

**Uri:** "Jack offsuit, just for the viewers, this guy has ninety VPIP, Ace the guy who opened. Given that, I would squeeze to more than fifteen big blinds."

**Eyal:** "Yeah?"

**Uri:** "Yeah, because guys with ninety VPIP don't care how big you go, they just click call anyway so you can go like twenty-five even. Fifteen would be the normal size, but this is not a normal player. It's very awkward with the Ace Jack, but I think you have to fold."

**Eyal:** "How would do you think about my turn bet?"

**Uri:** "I mean, I feel like I don't like it. It's very cool that he showed up with Seven Nine... The way I would think about this hand is, I think given he has ninety percent of preflop hands, which you can see is true immediately from the showdown, he does just call everything, he doesn't care. I think you're ahead on the flop, so one thing you could do is start out with a bet and we just call it a value bet. The other thing is to play more defensive and check and if you're checking, I'm not sure why you'd bet on the Queen specifically, why not keep checking? Is it like he didn't bet so he doesn't have a pair? Because he was just as likely to have a pair on the flop as on the turn."

**Eyal:** "It was value. I mean I was quite sure I was good in the turn and it was protection and value."

**Uri:** "Yeah, okay. So I guess I'll take it back. I think it's fair enough to play it the way you did, but let's say this guy is... he clearly likes attacking weakness, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So in the future against him you don't do weak bets with weak hands."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

## Hand 8: K♥3♥ - Donk Bet from Whale

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens K♥3♥ to 3BB from CO, BU calls, BB (90 VPIP whale) calls
- **Flop (K♣9♣8♦):** Whale donk bets 3.1BB into 9BB pot, Eyal calls, BU folds
- **Turn (A♣):** Whale bets 11.8BB into 15BB pot, Eyal snap folds

**Uri:** "Okay. And Nine Six suited, if there's no open, you could limp this hand as well."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "King Ten. It's okay."

**Eyal:** "Sounds like a dream to say that I can reach forty percent."

**Uri:** "Yeah, I was playing one of these forty percent minimum games and I had sixty-five percent VPIP. But yeah, one of the ways is also just to sit when the table's starting and you got some hands shorthanded, but you have to start... This Ten Seven of hearts is a much smaller mistake than some of the hands you're putting in money with. Whether you min raise or you limp, it's actually fine-ish, it's tiny bit losing, but you're forcing yourself into positions that are a lot worse by waiting."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Okay, cool. So King Three, you open. Again, you could open much bigger with this guy if you had a good hand."

**Eyal:** "You mean like to open 5x here?"

**Uri:** "Yeah, or bigger. Any size you want. He bets the turn, you snap fold. I mean, it's fine. It's interesting considering he showed the Nine Seven before. I'd at least have thought a bit more, but I think folding is probably good. Who knows what he had?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I was just waiting for a better spot, I guess."

## Hand 9: K♥Q♦ - Getting 3-Bet and Coolered

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens K♥Q♦ from BU, SB raises to 6.5BB, Eyal calls
- **Flop (Q♠Q♥6♦):** SB bets 7BB, Eyal calls
- **Turn (8♠):** SB bets 14BB, Eyal calls
- **River (4♠):** SB shoves, Eyal snap calls, SB wins with 8♥8♣

**Uri:** "You see? Here you go three and this guy goes six point seven, he's very, very likely to just call the six point seven."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, perfect."

**Uri:** "Yeah. And that's why you could just raise to that size to begin with. You don't have to... You really want to adjust the way you play to the way he's playing. Look at this, Jack Six."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, that was a mistake."

**Uri:** "Yeah. We'll stop talking about those. So here you decide to bluff the turn, I guess?, which is okay. Then you hit the Ace but the flush comes in which is actually quite bad, right? Because the main hand that's calling you on the turn is a flush draw."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Okay. And here, yeah, I guess you have to call this because you lose to a flush but you beat like a Seven Eight or something. King Queen, this guy goes... So this three bet is so small that you actually can't fold anything."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. I had a hand like this once where I called the three bet with King Three offsuit and I ended up making quads and beating Aces."

**Uri:** "So yeah, either way. Yeah, seems fine."

**Eyal:** "Unfortunate but fine."

**Uri:** "Well what's unfortunate for you is fortunate for him. So I always try to look at the bright side. You just made someone really happy."

**Eyal:** "It is true."

## Hand 10: King Queen 3-Betting the Whale

- **Preflop:** 90 VPIP whale opens to 3.5BB from LJ, Eyal 3-bets to 11.5BB with KQ, whale calls
- **Flop (K♣4♣4♥):** Eyal bets 10BB into 24BB pot, whale snap calls
- **Turn (2♠):** Eyal bets 22BB into 44BB pot, whale snap calls
- **River (T♥):** Eyal checks, whale shoves for 70BB, Eyal snap calls, whale shows 6♣5♣

**Uri:** "Okay... So here three bet with King Queen. This should be way bigger, right? Remember he's calling fifteen blinds with Nine Seven. And now, given before, I really, really want to do just..."

**Eyal:** "Small bet."

**Uri:** "Just look weak. If you bet half pot or seventy-five percent pot, I think it would be a big mistake versus this guy. Yeah, even smaller than this, I would say. And then after you look weak, just check to let him start bluffing. You really want to give him the opportunity to go crazy. But then, yeah, as played, he calls you twice, which is fine. Now clearly we're not in go-crazy territory. He actually has something, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So a lot of guys in his shoes would not have a Four anymore. He already showed you the Nine Seven and there's a flush draw. So it's very tempting for him to fast play with trips. Let's say his range is either a King or a flush draw. What would you like to do against that range? Or say Sixes, right? But mostly a King or a flush draw."

**Eyal:** "I mean Sixes, I want to bet. Flush draw, I want to check. And a King, I probably want a bet too."

**Uri:** "How big? I don't know how much money you have."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, it's probably my kind of... I decide to check because he seems crazy."

**Uri:** "Perfect. So if you go back to this hand, it looks like you played perfect, but you made two big mistakes here. One is you three bet too small, and two is you bet the turn. And if he hadn't turned the miracle gutshot, he'd have just folded. I think you needed to start letting him go crazy on the turn."

**Eyal:** "Yeah... It wasn't bad."

**Uri:** "So this is basic KYC. You know KYC? 'Know your customer'. Service rule, you need to know your customer. If you know your customer, with this guy you three bet bigger and you give him rope. You have to make sure to give him an opportunity to put a stack in with trash. So you never wanted to barrel him with medium looking sizes because you're giving him opportunities to fold his trash. You need to let your customer put in a stack with trash."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

## Observing Whale Patterns

**Uri:** "Perfect, okay. Deuces call. That's good. Queen Ten on Six Six Five. This is a spot which you're not supposed to bet very much."

**Eyal:** "I did because I read the note on the guy on the left and he donks for value."

**Uri:** "Perfect. Okay, I love it. I take it back. But in theory, they hit the board more than you do. But yeah."

**Eyal:** "Otherwise I wouldn't bet here."

**Uri:** "Yeah."

**Eyal:** "But why wouldn't, I mean... I just wouldn't bet because they don't have... (unintelligible)."

**Uri:** "Well, so your range when you open the button is a lot of hands that are Nine or higher. Ten Nine offsuit, Jack Nine offsuit, Jack Ten offsuit, Queen Jack offsuit. Most of your hands are Nine or higher, or maybe Eight or higher. So when the board is three low cards, you just don't hit it very much. And these guys play more of the low cards than you do. So they have more trips. That means that... One of the things we think about boards is, who is the board better for? And this is one of the boards that's better for these two guys than it is for you. The more low cards there are, the better it is for them. The more high cards, the better for you. High-card boards you get very aggressive and low-card boards you kind of... mostly you check and hope the board improves for you. So here I would just say, 'oh, thank you for letting me hit a Queen or a Ten', check back, see what the turn is."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "It's not like it's fine to bet, but just in your head it's not an auto-bet type of spot."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. Looks like there's going to be a big pot with a high VPIP player on the left."

**Uri:** "I guess he's folding?"

**Eyal:** "Let me see.. Ah, here."

**Uri:** "There you go. Let's look at this hand with Tens versus Ace Four. This guy, because he plays every hand, there's a very high chance you're going to end up playing with him. And so we really want to pay attention to what he's doing. Let's see if the screen's not too blocked. Yeah. It looks like... Again, we'll go here. You see here, this looks like BvB, he goes bet seventy-five and the other guy raises him with Ace Four. He has Tens, he calls and then he is going to call down, right? So kind of just a calling station, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Now, I don't say calling station, I'm not judging whether the call is good or bad. I just feel like if he's calling this hand, he's probably just calling everything and it fits with the profile. This is a guy against whom you don't really want to be bluffing. We already saw he can re-bluff you with air, he can call you down with anything. So this guy with Ace Four made a huge mistake. Perfect."

"King Four of spades, you should limp from the small blind or raise, but not fold."

"Ace Jack, how big do you raise? something bigger than this, right? Because this guy at the table is actually driving all of your decisions now."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Wait, did he just raise you to thirty-one bigs? Sure. No, I like folding here. We have no indication. He's likely to call this very wide and I'm sure maybe he'll raise this with Jacks or something, which he maybe shouldn't, but I wouldn't think he goes too crazy there."

**Eyal:** "And the other guys are actually more..."

**Uri:** "They have real ranges too. But I'd expect him to be quite strong there, you see?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "What do you think about the guy calling him with Ace Four?"

**Eyal:** "Well, I mean, probably a good move."

**Uri:** "I mean no, it's a terrible move, but he's a good guy to have at your table because if you go back, the guy with Ace Four actually started by cold calling the three bet with Ace Four."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, I know I took a note about that. Calling with Ace Four and then calling the squeeze. Preflop it was terrible, but on the flop, I'm questioning..."

**Uri:** "No, flop, whatever, it's fine. But basically these two guys at your table should be driving most of your decisions. So you should be raising bigger, you should maybe be raising a bit tighter even and focus all of your attention on those guys and what they're doing. Also the guy left the table. That's unfortunate."

**Eyal:** "He did. So here I saw... this is an important hand, actually, because I saw him... This guy on the left, Kobi, he stacked off with Deuce Five suited."

**Uri:** "Which guy, RandomBoy?"

**Eyal:** "On the top left table."

**Uri:** "Oh, he stacked off Deuce Five? How did that go in? He three bet and... Yeah, okay."

**Eyal:** "So I took a note and then I later decide I'll let him make the move based on that note. But actually it was quite costly."

**Uri:** "Yeah, the thing with the stacking off Deuce Five is how deep he is. And a lot of guys when they get short, and you'll see this in live games too, they just go, 'yeah, let's put it all-in. Let's gamble. Either I double up or I'll reload.' And of course he's a loose guy, but that's not indicative that he's going to do that once he reloads. He might not do that again. Does that make sense?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah. So you treat it very differently if it's his last twenty blinds or if he has maybe he has eighty."

**Uri:** "When he has eighty, there's no reason to think he's doing that. I want to see that costly mistake. So Jack Eight, he probably limp? Okay. Yeah, let's see this hand against him."

"Here someone went six, he called with Six Seven and he's somehow at seventy bigs, maybe he reloaded more. And what we're going to see is this guy goes all-in, basically, on Deuce Three Four, which is ridiculous by the way. Obviously you shouldn't do that. And now look at their hands. So what do you take away from him putting in a stack with Six Seven there?"

**Eyal:** "He's a dreamer."

**Uri:** "The word I use is gambler. He's basically playing poker to gamble, right? It is a gamble gambling game. We treat it as a strategy game, but it's just a gambling game. So when he has nice cards, he gambles. These kind of guys sometimes seem aggressive because they put their stack in a lot, but really it's just when their cards match the board, they put the money in. Like a slot machine. When it goes the three cherries and you're like, 'Yay! Ding, ding, ding!' Like a slot machine thing?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "That's this type of guy. So I would categorize him in my head that way. And then in the future you just want to gamble with him when you have good hands, basically. The guy with Queens is just ridiculous."

**Eyal:** "I know. Huge overbet..."

**Uri:** "Yeah, just very direct with good hands... Yeah, great tables."

## Hand 11: K♣Q♠ on K-9-9

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens KQ to 3BB from UTG+1, CO calls, HJ calls
- **Flop (K♠9♣9♥):** Eyal bets 5.2BB into 10.5BB pot, both fold

**Uri:** "Okay, let's see. Here with King Queen, again, we have a sixty-two-VPIP guy. So again, probably someone you should be paying attention to and King Queen is good."

**Eyal:** "Probably would've been good, but..."

**Uri:** "Not necessarily."

**Eyal:** "I'm just not the dreamer, I guess."

**Uri:** "With King Queen, I'd start out checking on King Nine Nine. I think not too many good things happen when you bet, especially bet big..."

**Eyal:** "Half a pot is big in this case, right?"

**Uri:** "I think so. I think so. Because you're narrowing their ranges very quickly by doing this, right? And you don't have anything near the nuts, so I had to be careful doing it. Here on the left, Kobi's VPIP kind of matches and here he goes, small. Is this the hand where you just got... I can kind of see it. I think it's reasonable."

**Eyal:** "I expected him to call me, but with a King Ten suited or..."

**Uri:** "Yeah, he for sure would. But I guess he has a different hand this time. That's fine. I think you played that well. Just unlucky. Or lucky? No, unlucky. Almost lucky."

**Eyal:** "Redemption?"

**Uri:** "Well, yeah, I mean the sky's playing all the hands. Let's see how big you managed to go."

**Eyal:** "Probably not big... ah, no hand."

## Hand 12: A♥A♦ - Deep Stack SPR Discussion

- **Preflop:** HJ (62 VPIP) opens to 3BB, CO calls, BU 3-bets to 13BB, Eyal 4-bets to 38.4BB from BB with A♥A♦, only BU calls
- **Flop (T♦8♥2♣):** Eyal bets 27BB into 80BB pot (SPR 1.5), BU snap folds

**Uri:** "Yeah. So here you have one and a half times the pot. So again, you want to go with small bets."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Right."

**Eyal:** "Question is if a third of pot is small enough."

**Uri:** "I think it's probably a bit too big, right? You really... If you think about it, it's very easy to put your stack in with Aces, so you really want to give him a chance to bluff or to catch up. We want to make some size where when he has King Queen suited, he doesn't feel very happy folding. He's like, 'ah, that size is making me angry.' Right? You want to troll the person you're playing with."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Generally, if you want to pick a size, just imagine you're a troll and ask yourself which size would the troll pick? That's actually serious advice. It sounds like a joke, but that is how it works. You pick a size that's the most annoying for him when he misses."

**Eyal:** "About the preflop though? How much would you make it if it was..."

**Uri:** "You guys are very deep. I think you went with a good size. Yeah, generally going three to 4x out of position is good whenever there's a lot of money behind."

**Eyal:** "Okay. If it was like a hundred deep. So just a bit more wise."

**Uri:** "Yeah, exactly. Exactly."

"Okay. So Ace Four of clubs, probably call. It's good. Again, we're there to gamble with Kobi mostly."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

## Hand 13: A♣9♣ - Lucky Two Pair

- **Preflop:** UTG limps, Eyal raises to 4BB with A♣9♣, SB calls, BB calls, UTG calls
- **Flop (5♠A♦4♣):** Checks around
- **Turn (9♥):** BB bets 8BB, UTG calls, Eyal raises to 28BB, BB calls
- **River (7♥):** BB checks, Eyal shoves for 73BB, BB calls with A♥5♥

**Uri:** "Ace Nine of clubs, you can go bigger than four big blinds when you're with the gambly guys."

**Eyal:** "How much would you make it here?"

**Uri:** "I don't know, seven. Seven, eight, something big. And you check Ace Nine. I think that's okay. It's fine to bet as well because it's the kind of board where they can't really catch up to something that you're happy with, right? It's not like they turn a pair of Tens and suddenly they're putting tons of money in, so there's not much benefit. But yeah, it's fine. It's a medium strength hand and now not a medium strength hand anymore, of course. So here you're going to raise and they're both going to fold maybe, behind, they'll call you. Let's see. No? what do you mean no? Okay, so presumably he just has an Ace, right?"

**Eyal:** "A bit better, actually, I was lucky."

**Uri:** "Oh wow! okay. Better lucky than good, right? That's a famous saying in poker."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "That's what he should say to you when you do that to him."

**Eyal:** "Maybe. It was a good Nine, right?"

**Uri:** "No, you played perfect. You played fine. Yeah, because right, you're navigating your hand to a pot size. That hand doesn't want a huge pot size, so you check back and then suddenly you do want a huge pot size. So you raise, yeah, I think it's perfect. It's interesting how you never get anyone to... you never take the blinds preflop in these games, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah. You don't get walks, unless you're shorthanded or something."

## Hand 14: 8♦9♣ - Kobi's Small 3-Bet

- **Preflop:** Eyal opens 8♦9♣ from LJ, BU (Kobi) 3-bets to 7.2BB, BB calls, Eyal calls
- **Flop (T♦8♠3♣):** Check/check, BU bets 18.7BB into 23.7BB pot, Eyal calls
- **Turn (5♠):** Check/check
- **River (5♦):** Eyal bets 19.5BB into 59BB pot, BU folds

**Uri:** "So Eight Nine, I want you to pay attention to the size from Kobi. You remember when he had the Ace King, he went eleven, right?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "So the fact he's going seven here, if eleven is Ace King, what's seven?"

**Eyal:** "Probably like a King Ten suited?"

**Uri:** "Five Deuce suited? No, it's called 'the deuce three bet'. They're just three betting to get more gambly because the pot's too small."

**Eyal:** "Okay."

**Uri:** "So either way you have to call, it's too small."

**Eyal:** "Yeah, absolutely."

**Uri:** "Okay, cool. And you make a pair and... Yeah, I'm surprised to see a big bet but here I just call, like I said, because I put him on this very speculative range. Now I think you probably have the best hand, but he also probably just has air."

**Eyal:** "Yeah. So I should probably... I probably bet too much here again, I never bet less than half into the pot."

**Uri:** "Yeah. So first of all, you should get into troll mode and be like, you can bet one big blind, you can bet any size you want, you have complete freedom."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "And you can also just check and give him a chance to bluff with his air. But yeah, I do think this was a bit too big, but just fine. Yeah, it's fine. I don't mind it. Okay, are we done?"

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

## Key Takeaways

**Uri:** "Cool. So I'll recap. I think you played a lot of hands very well. I think one thing you should pay a ton of attention to is adjusting to the gamblers at the table and not playing your standard poker game when you're in hands with them. We said re-raise bigger, give them rope to bluff you. You should be in a different mindset when you're against these guys and these are the guys who you're making the most money from. Like this guy, this fourteen VPIP nit, Kadimma, or this twenty-seven VPIP nit, or this eight VPIP nit. Maybe you outplay them, maybe you don't. But most of the money is coming from the guys with fifty, sixty VPIP who are gambling and playing every hand. So it's very important to maximize against those guys."

"And we talked about how in loose-range situations, so blind versus blind, you want to do more bluffing. We talked about how I think in the Aces hand, not this one, different one. You got a lot of Aces in the session, I must say. But yeah, there was a hand where like we said, you want to kind of overplay the top of your range versus these guys. So when you make a good hand to put in even more money than you should and just you count on them being very loose and crazy with their ranges."

"And let me think if there was anything else. No, I think your style is kind of good for these games just to focus more on the 'know your customer' rule."

**Eyal:** "Yeah."

**Uri:** "Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much."

**Eyal:** "Okay, thanks for your assistance."

**Uri:** "Bye mate."
