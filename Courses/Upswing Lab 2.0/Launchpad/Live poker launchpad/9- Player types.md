My summary: Broadly speaking there are players who
1. never bluff (fold all bluffcatcher!)
OR
2. love to bluff too much (give them rope!)

and hero call (against which I should value bet thinly) vs hero folds (against which I should put a lot of pressure)

Also vs people who donk-bet, their check range is weak as fk.

and finally, there are players where bet size = hand strength, and players that bet based on what they want me to do(bet big = they want me to fold, bet small = they want me to call)
# Player Types and Exploits

## Core Concepts

### Players Who Don't Like Bluffing

"There are players who like bluffing and there are players who don't like bluffing. And in live games you can often tell very quickly which do or which don't. You might see people who when their draw misses, they show the draw and check and give up in the muck, or when they re-raise and miss they check."

"Very often, people who don't like bluffing, it's very important to categorize them in your head because against these guys, one of the ways in which you make money is that you fold when they bet, especially on the river. And don't try to bluff-catch. Recognize whether or not your hand is a bluff-catcher and if this is a guy who doesn't like bluffing, you can make some very big folds and definitely don't confuse yourself. Don't randomize. Don't try to get into leveling wars. Guys who don't like bluffing, you generally stay out of the way."

### Players Who Love Bluffing

"Of course there are people who love bluffing and you definitely want to recognize them and you want to give them rope, generally speaking, and call down quite wide because they're almost certainly overdoing it."

### Bluff-Catching Tendencies

"Same goes for bluff-catching. Some guys are looking for opportunities to hero call and other guys are looking for opportunities to hero fold. Both of these player types tend to make themselves very, very obvious."

**Against Hero Callers:** "You generally want to go for thin value and don't overbluff. Maybe don't bluff very much against the guys who like being heroes."

**Against Hero Folders:** "Against the guys who like folding, you definitely don't go for thin value and you just bluff your pants off, basically, whenever you're in the pot with them."

### Players Who Don't Understand Initiative

"Another kind of player archetype that's very common in live games is people who don't really understand initiative. They don't understand checking to the raiser. And they generally bet when they hit rather than betting in a polarized way. They might bet a gutshot and a top pair and a middle pair, and a bottom pair. They might actually bet with all of those."

"The reason they're doing this... You could think of a slot machine where when your cards hit, you put in more money. Maybe they're trying to understand where they're at, get some information."

**How to Exploit:** "What ends up happening with these players is, on the one hand, whenever they check, they're very, very weak and they're going to fold. But when they bet, and they do bet quite often, their range isn't intuitive to play against. Like you might call third pair and lose to second pair, or you might call second pair hoping they're bluffing only to see top pair, low kicker."

"So when they're betting, it's important to recognize that's where the strong hands are, so don't look to play back at it necessarily just because the frequency is high, and also recognize how wide the range that they're betting is. So when these guys bet and you have a decent top pair, you can actually start raising and barreling for value because their betting range is actually fairly similar to what their flop check-calling range should be. It's a bit stronger, but not much stronger. So raises with decent showdown value or with good draws actually do very, very well against these types of players."

### Bet Sizing Tells

"Another really important thing to pay attention to is bet sizes. There are some guys who when they have a good hand, they size small to keep you in, and there are some guys who when they have a good hand size big because it's a big hand."

"So we want to pay attention to, are people sizing based on what they want you to do, so a big bet would be to get you to fold, and a small bet would be to get you to call? Or are they sizing according to their hand and then a big bet is a big hand and when they make a small bet, it's either a bluff or you can raise and they'll fold their weak value?"

## Key Takeaways

"All of these things are very, very common in live games, and we're going to kind of go through and see examples of how to catch people doing them."
