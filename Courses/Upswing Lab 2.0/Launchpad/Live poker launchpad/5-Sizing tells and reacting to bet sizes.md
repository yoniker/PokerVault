# Standard Sizings in Live Poker

## Core Concepts

### Introduction to Live Sizing Variations

"Hey guys. This is going to be a video about standard sizings. I want to kind of walk through how sizings in poker work, which ones you should use, how you should react to different ones..."

"Whereas online stuff is kind of standardized, so you almost don't need me to tell you the sizings, so you can just sit down and everyone's taking the same sizings, in live it varies quite a lot and there is definitely room for interpretation and for creativity with sizings."

### The Foundation: Playing for the Blinds

"The premise of poker is we're playing to win the blinds. If there wasn't any dead money from the blinds preflop, everyone would play only Aces, so it's all around the blinds."

"This is what live players often don't realize or don't agree with. To them it's about sitting down to play, it's not about winning the blinds. But strategically it is."

### Risk-Reward Framework

"All of the sizes tend to be based a bit on risk-reward for winning the blinds, so if there's a ten dollar big blind and a five dollar small blind, how much are you risking to win those fifteen dollars since the options are to limp and then you let them see the flop for free, it's always going to be a raise, but it turns out that it doesn't have to be a very big raise."

### Standard Opening Sizes

"The standard sizing, when you ask a computer what to do is something between raising two to three times the size of the big blind. This creates a situation where the small blind and the big blind both have tough decisions with a lot of their range and have to do quite a lot of folding."

### Three-Bet and Four-Bet Sizing

"The same kind of goes for three bets and four bets. Let's say I raised to three big blinds and you now want to re-raise me. You're now playing to win the three plus one plus half, so four and a half big blinds of dead money. How much do you risk to do that? Again, between two and 3x. What I've put in the middle is generally the rule."

### The Theory Behind Sizing

"That also tends to be what gives me a tough decision because if it's much lower than that, any cards in poker have equity, they have a chance to win, so when you go too low, everything continues and we're really hunting for that place where people have a bit of a tough time."

### Stack Depth Considerations

"Now, let's say someone three bet, you raise to three, someone three bet to nine. Now we're talking about a four bet. That kind of new concept comes into play, which is how much money do you have behind?"

"Because if we went by all the rules that we said before, we'd say, 'oh, well there's now thirteen and a half big blinds of dead money. Let's go somewhere between twenty-seven to forty, big blind four bet.' And that would actually be reasonable if you were very, very deep. But if you're a hundred deep, going to a forty big blind four bet, you're pot committed at that point, so it's too big."

### Inflection Points and Stack Adjustments

"In certain stack depths there are these inflection points of suddenly the four bet, rather than being 3x the previous raises, it's kind of capped at... you either go all-in or you go up to say a quarter of your stack. You don't go more than that without basically committing yourself."

### Example Sizing Progressions

"So, very standard sizing scheme would be, say, raised to two, three bet to seven, you could four bet to twenty-one. But if it's raised to three, three bet to twelve, you'd be four betting to twenty-seven or thirty or something like that at a hundred deep and you could go bigger, deeper. This is kind of ABC. What do sizings look like?"

### Reacting to Non-Standard Sizes

"So, how do we react when people size is bigger or smaller than they should? First of all, it's poker. Poker is a game of information. If you feel like people are giving away information about their hand, maybe their big size is weak or their small size is strong or the other way around, definitely pounce on that. Always advocate for going after those kinds of things if you're confident about them."

### Impact on Different Hand Strengths

"But generally speaking, as people raise bigger, three bet bigger, four bet bigger, et cetera, what happens is that your medium strength hands have a tougher time of it. Your good hands are great, your bad hands are folding anyway, but your medium hands start having a tougher time."

### Identifying Vulnerable Hands

"And then the question is recognizing the threshold between what is and what isn't a medium strength hand. That's something you can start to practice with charts and with videos here."

"But as a rule of thumb, let's say pocket pairs, suited connectors, suited broadways are the sensitive hands where as the size gets bigger, these hands start leaning more towards folding and of course will fold Deuces and Threes and Fours before we fold Fives, Sixes and Sevens, et cetera."

## Key Takeaways

### Standard Sizing Framework

- **Opens:** 2-3x the big blind
- **3-bets:** 2-3x the open raise (typically ending around 7-12BB)
- **4-bets:** 2-3x the 3-bet OR capped at 25% of stack when 100BB deep

### Stack Depth Adjustments

- Deep stacks: Can follow standard multipliers
- 100BB stacks: 4-bet capped at ~25% of stack
- Avoid pot-committing without going all-in

### Hand Categories vs Sizing

- **Premium hands:** Perform well regardless of sizing
- **Trash hands:** Fold regardless of sizing
- **Medium hands (vulnerable):**
    - Small pocket pairs (22-77)
    - Suited connectors
    - Suited broadways
    - These hands struggle as sizes increase

### Exploitative Adjustments

- Look for sizing tells from opponents
- Exploit when sizing reveals hand strength
- Adjust continuation range based on opponent's sizing tendencies
