My summary: When playing against very loose players, the range of hands that I want to 3-bet or can consider 3-betting widens just a little bit, nothing crazy, in both early positions and late positions (although late positions can 3-bet A5o/A4o very a very loose player that's how wide it goes), suited broadways, pairs, suited connectors, and the best offsuit broadways (AQo/AJo/KQo).
# Playing Against Wide, Loose Openers (37% Range)

## Core Concepts

### Introduction and Setup

"Okay man. So this is gonna be about how to play versus a wider, more loosey player. You guys see the locked raise first in range here. So this is, again, 200 deep. It's a rake free sim because I think your edge should be way bigger than the rake. So we're gonna ignore the rake."

### The Opponent's Opening Range

"Um, and yeah, this is the opening range I gave him. So again, this is meant to model a wide loose player. There is some hands that are all blue, which he always raises and some hands, which I gave him at like a low frequency because he'll show up with them sometimes, but not always. The end result is a 37% range."

### Surprising Similarity to Tighter Ranges

"So how wide can we play against this guy? So he raises under the gun, and this is the UTG plus one response. And you guys might be pretty surprised seeing this if you previously saw the 22% response because it's not that different, right?"

"The 22% wouldn't have had King 10 suited, um, and it wouldn't have had King Jack, Ace Jack, Ace Queen, it wouldn't have had King five, it wouldn't have had Ace three and Ace nine, so that it's a bit wider, it's not super duper wider. And again, the reason is there are still six people behind and that's a very driving factor between how wide we can play."

### Filling in the Blanks

"And here again, I'll add that when you see this, you can, depending on table conditions, but the way I'd conceptualize this is, oh, if you can go this far and you can go up to King five suited. So I'm kind of filling in the blanks for the program."

"Uh, right, if you can have six five, you can have the suited connectors. If you can have sevens, you can have the pairs. If you can have King Jack, you can have Ace 10, you can have Ace 10 and have Queen Jack. Like these hands are similar enough in my eyes."

### The Range Differences

"So you guys can see this is a 9% range. This is a 21% range. And the difference between me and this program is I'm saying these are the hands I would consider playing and then I'll play them if the rest of the table is more passive. If there's a big whale behind me, I think, you know, I just want to play more hands."

### Using Reads to Go Wider

"If I have a read on this guy, if, you know, sometimes you have a bit of a physical read, like he's not at the top of his opening range, right? Just 'cause people look a bit different when they have Aces or kings or he's a bit on tilt, whatever. Like if, if you want a reason to go wide, this is as wide as I would reasonably go. Uh, but by no means feel obligated to play these hands."

### Understanding Hand Profitability

"So I know that most of them, and we talked about this earlier in in the courses, most hands are in theory not making you much money. Most of these hands are not making you much money unless you have an edge. It's mostly the premiums that make you money here."

"So I'd feel in no way obligated, but if I wanted to get in there, this is about as wide as I'd go from UTG plus one."

### Position-Based Widening

"After UTG plus one folds, uh, we're gonna kind of see how the program slowly widens these and so far it looks like it's widening it in the same direction I was going, right? So it's saying, oh, less people behind you can have more of these same hand types, right?"

"And as we kind of get to the button, this is starting to look more like the maximal range. I recommended if you guys want to compare, um, this and this are starting to look more similar again, what you call and what you three bet is completely up to you and it's not very important."

### Surprising Three-Bet Candidates

"The surprising thing this year is Ace four off suit and Ace five off suit. And I, I personally would not go for three betting these, uh, but turns out you can, I mean the guy is opening very wide, so I guess you probably can can just reraise him with, with random, uh, Ace plus nothing."

### Adjusting to Non-Folders

"Um, now I'll kind of add very often the guy who's opening wide doesn't fold to three bets. So if he doesn't fold to three bets, um, definitely when there aren't many people behind you, you just three bet your best hands and call the next level."

"Like, I'd never three bet Ace five off or six, seven suited against someone who's not gonna fold. And I'd never flat Ace Queen suited or Jacks or Tens against someone who's not gonna fold. So I, this is called a linear strategy."

### Dynamic Considerations

"When you're in earlier positions, the fact he's not gonna fold, should make you go more linear and definitely less bluff, but there's also the rest of the table behind you. So you might sometimes want to trap a big hand, uh, or three bet a medium hand to avoid other people squeezing or things like that. So it's more dynamic."

"But yeah, generally speaking against these stereotypes, even though we see the charts and all the mixes, uh, we would want to kind of always three bet the, the better hands and always call the worst ones."

### Big Blind Defense

"Um, and yeah, if we go down to the big blind, you guys can see over and over again, it's kind of the same group of hands, which I find, you know, just very useful. So five x open from a very wide range and we see that the hands we can consider playing tend to be the same group of hands, and the more people behind us, the tighter we should be."

### Playing Against Weak Players

"Uh, Now I'll throw in an extra sentence in there that, you know, given these guys who play 40% of hands tend not to be very good players. Uh, you could make a case for playing more hands, but the fact that someone's not good doesn't necessarily mean you can play, uh, more hands against him."

"It often means that just your good hands make more money because you know, they put in too much money all the time. So someone not good who plays lots of hands, uh, if you play lots of hands against him, I'm sure you'll outmaneuver him, but it, he might kind of be sticky and aggro and then all your weak hands don't... Like, why would you play a hand that's behind his range due to some post flop edge when really your edge is when you hit a nut, uh, not by bluffing."

### Small Blind Strategy

"And one thing I'll add just because we haven't covered it, generally speaking, when you're in the small blind specifically, uh, theory is you play mostly three bets and almost no calls. Um, I would generally recommend sticking to this, but you don't have to."

"And kind of to prove that, uh, we'll look at the EVs in the program and say, well, eights is always reraising, but the EV of raising and calling is the same. Um, Ace 10 off suit is always folding, but the EV of raising and calling is the same."

"So yeah, small blind with a player behind, we usually would rather reraise, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. You guys can still go either way. Just remember you're out of position. So definitely be tighter in the small blind and, and wider in the button."

## Key Takeaways

### The Basic Response Range

"So I I I feel like this range is wide enough. I think it's a good solid range. So kind of to recap, uh, we're saying you play roughly this, so top 21% of hands can go a bit wider, a bit narrower, but these are the hands that you consider playing against these guys. And I think that should be a fairly good starting point."

### Core Principles

- Players behind remain the primary limiting factor
- Response range isn't dramatically different vs 37% opener compared to 22% opener
- Most hands don't make money without an edge - premiums carry the profit
- Linear strategy (best hands 3-bet, medium hands call) against non-folders

### Adjustments Based on Context

- Table passivity allows wider play
- Physical reads can justify wider ranges
- Sticky aggressive opponents reduce the value of speculative hands
- Small blind prefers 3-betting over calling but flexibility exists

### Position Matters

- UTG+1: ~9% base range, up to 21% with reads
- Button: Approaches maximal defendable range
- Small blind: Tighter and more 3-bet oriented
- Big blind: Same hand categories, adjusted for position
