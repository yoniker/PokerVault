Since live players:
1. Overfold to small flop bets (don't appreiate backdoors)
2. Overfold to overbets
One of Uri's favorite lines is bet small flop-over bet turn - give up river
OR
small flop,small turn, overbet river
OR
Small flop check turn overbet river.

Also, I should bet a lot on scarecards (like an overcard) turns.

# Exploiting Weaker Players as the Aggressor

## Core Concepts

### Setting the Framework

"Okay, let's say you've recognized a lot of people at your table are weaker players compared to you and you've decided that you're going to raise a bit wider, you're going to re-raise them a bit wider. What kind of mistakes do we expect them to make right off the bat?"

"I think is an important question because otherwise I'm saying, 'oh, this guy's weaker. You can play wider', but then what do you really do? Most of the time in Hold'em you miss the flop. Maybe you think the guy's a station. You guys might be a bit lost with regards to what to do."

### General Tendencies of Weaker Players

"So we're going to talk about some basic tips as the aggressor. Generally speaking, everything I'm saying is a broad generalization and you guys, as you play, you can adapt it to specific players, but the guys you're going to be playing with are going to be folding too much and they're going to be folding too much specifically in heads-up pots."

### Why They Fold Too Much to C-bets

"They'll fold too much to the first bet that you make due to not correctly recognizing the value of backdoors and not necessarily recognizing textures and also playing kind of wide ranges. So usually your first bet will make you some money."

"There are some exceptions like very, very connected boards where it's easier to hit. So once... If the board is Five Seven Nine, then you hit with a Five, Seven or a Nine, but also a Six or an Eight or Jack Ten. So those boards get hit more, but the boards that don't have the straight generally are going to be overfolded."

### The Overbet Principle

"Also, they're going to overfold to continuous aggression, especially to the first overbet. This is based on kind of a mathematical principle, which I've gone through in the past, but I'm going to go through again, if I bet pot you need to call half your range. But if I bet one-and-a-half-x pot, you need to call forty percent of your range."

"That's not very intuitive to people because the bet is a lot bigger, so the natural inclination of people is to fold too much to an overbet."

## Hand Examples

### Example 1: Overbet on Jack-High Board

**Setup:** "I can show you guys a simple example of this to get a good framework in your mind and you guys can compare this to what's going to happen in your actual games. What we're going to do is open a board, we're going to be a hundred big blinds deep, cutoff versus big blind, Jack Eight Four."

- **Flop (Jh 8d 4d):** "What I'm going to do is I'm going to click check, say bet small, call."
    
- **Turn (2s):** "I'm going to take some bricky turn like a Deuce. So after a small bet, they're going to overfold to the first overbet. Here I click check. We're going to click overbet and you're going to see the defense range for the out of position player."
    

**Required Defense:** "And what you guys will see is that they need to call every single Jack on the turn, plus they need to call... you can click on second pair, roughly half of their second pairs. They need to call a little bit of third pairs."

"This is just too much for most people. Most guys, when they see the overbet, they freak out. They might even fold some top pairs, certainly not getting ready to call an Eight. The overbet puts them a bit in fight-or-flight mode, where they think you're just repping the nuts."

### Example 2: Overbet on Ace-High Board

"And this is generally true. Imagine... Switch the board around. We say, Ace Seven Deuce. Ace high boards people hit a lot more of course, because it's the most commonly played card."

- **Flop (Ac 7d 2s):** "So we bet small."
    
- **Turn (Qd):** "Turn is the Queen of diamonds. And check. We overbet and our opponents need to continue almost every single top pair in their range to the turn overbet."
    

"Of course, because it's an Ace, it's enough to continue top pair. On a Jack, you need to continue wider. But the issue here is a lot of guys, when they see the overbet and they look down at Ace Four, they're going to think, 'oh shit, I'm never winning' and just muck it."

### Default Bluffing Strategy

"So the first overbet tends to get overfolds, as a rule of thumb. So I'd say my bluffing strategy as a beginning default against weaker players would be to bet small on the flop, or bet medium on the flop, and either bet medium on the turn and overbet the river or overbet the turn and give up the river. I think both of those are okay and I'd expect those to overperform as bluffs."

"And it's also okay to bet flop, check turn, and bet river. That also tends to overperform because they end up checking a very weak range to you on the river. This is the first way in which we can exploit weaker players with a betting lead."

### Example 3: Scare Cards and Capped Ranges

"Another way to exploit weaker players when you have the betting lead is to take advantage of a concept of good card, bad card and capped ranges. I'll give you guys an example. This is how people used to play for years and years, so it's something you should know. It's just not spoken of as often these days."

- **Flop (Th 6d 2d):** "We're going to look at a Ten Six Deuce, two-tone board. On this board, after we bet flop, let's say we make a medium-sized bet, our opponent's calling range is around the board, so a Ten, Six and a Deuce."

"So any overcard to the board is what's known as a scare card for them. A very classic one would be a King. Because of the King is a scary card, any hand that they called that didn't improve is not going to be top pair. Imagine they have Ace Six or Six Seven or Ten Eight. All these hands are not feeling great."

- **Turn (King):** "So when your opponent checks the turn and you fire a two-thirds-pot bet for example, he's going to need to defend a lot of hands he's not going to be comfortable with. First of all, every single Ten. But also quite a lot of just hands with a pair of Sixes and hands with a pair of Deuces are going to have to make the turn call. And this is very, very uncomfortable for people to do."

### Continuing Aggression on Scare Cards

"Another thing that you can do is, as the runout comes overcards, so scary cards for the other guy, just keep putting on pressure and pay attention to, are people calling you down light? Or do they just keep saying, 'oh shit, you must have hit the King' and fold? Generally speaking, it's going to be more often the second, so this is just a good bluffing line."

"Basically bluff on good runouts or bluff on scare cards or bluff on overcards. Any way you want to look at it."

### Live Tell Advantage

"And especially if you're playing live, sometimes you'll actually be able to see when your opponent improves on the turn. That is something you can see by a shift in their body language. Do they like the turn or dislike the turn? So if you have that, it's even better and more valuable information."

- **River (Five):** "But for example here, if our opponent doesn't have a King often, we just put in a second bet and then a third big bet, right? Say the river is a Five and because our opponent is a bit capped from the flop, of course he improves to some Kings, but if we fire, there should be more bet sizes here."

"Yeah, it doesn't look like this specific simulation has the best sizes, but he's going to have to call weaker than a King to three bets. And we're basically counting on him not to do that."

## Key Takeaways

### Primary Exploits

- Weaker players fold too much in heads-up pots
- They don't recognize backdoor value properly
- They overfold to continuous aggression
- First overbet gets massive overfolds

### Default Bluffing Lines

1. **Small flop → Medium turn → Overbet river**
2. **Small/medium flop → Overbet turn → Give up river**
3. **Bet flop → Check turn → Bet river**

### Mathematical Framework

- Pot-sized bet requires 50% defense
- 1.5x pot requires 40% defense
- Players intuitively fold too much to overbets

### Board Texture Considerations

- Avoid bluffing connected boards (5h 9s 7s)
- Target disconnected boards with overcards
- Use scare cards (Kings, Aces) to your advantage
- Exploit capped ranges after flop calls

### Live-Specific Edge

- Watch for body language shifts on turns
- Identify when opponents like/dislike cards
- Use physical tells to refine bluffing frequency
