# How to Play Low Pairs

## Core Concepts

"Low pairs, generally speaking, are going to make two types of hands. One hand is a very weak showdown value hand that mostly wants no money to go in and your main shot at winning is no one making any bets, or maybe one tiny one. And the other hand is something extremely, extremely strong."

"So the way these hands perform is kind of poor, poor, poor, amazing, poor, poor, poor, amazing. And you really need to be aware of that when you're playing these hands."

"Win the most and lose the least when you flop a poor hand is a lot of the proficiency with these. When you flop an amazing hand, of course you want to win the most."

## Hand Examples

### Hand 1: BvB with Pocket Deuces

**Preflop:** "We raise Deuces BvB. We get re-raised. Here we call and I will add that if our opponent was very short or if he made this much bigger, at some point you can start considering folding with Deuces, but most games and most situations, pocket pairs will be able to continue versus a re-raise."

**Flop (7♥ 7♠ 5♣):** "We get actually a fairly strong board for Deuces because we are ahead of Ace King and all of our opponents non-paired hands missed, so we can put a tiny bit more money in, but not very much. So we start with a check. Our opponent bets half pot and we call kind of aware that if more money goes in we're not doing very well."

**Turn (Q♠):** "Terrible card for us, but really, which card isn't? We check, happily enough our opponent checks back."

**River (9♥):** "Of course we're checking again. We only beat a bluff. If our opponent checks back somehow Ace King, Ace Jack, whatever, some give-up, we're going to win. If he makes a bet, just a tough decision because we only beat bluffs and luckily he checks back with King Jack suited."

"It's very important as you're playing the hand to realize, preflop, you kind of have to call, your not thrilled; flop, you kind of have to call, your not thrilled, but at what point you no longer have to call?"

### Hand 2: Flatting Pocket Threes vs Cutoff

**Preflop:** "Our opponent raises on the cutoff. We flat Threes"

**Flop (J♠ 8♦ 6♠):** "Get a very bad board for our hand and really our best bet is for this to check down. So check, check."

**Turn (8♠):** "Check, check."

**River (8♣):** "Our hand has now suddenly got the magic runout. It's kind of reasonable, I mean, as good as you can get, except for a Three. And we still check down because we still lose to Fours, Fives, Sevens, Sixes et cetera. You are not winning that often."

### Hand 3: Button with Pocket Fives vs Big Blind

**Preflop:** "We raise the button with Fives, get called from the big blind."

**Flop (T♥ 3♠ J♠ two-tone):** "Get bad board for our hand. Jack Ten Three, two-tone. Opponent checks and we decide to throw in a small bet. This small bet is most of the time as much as we'd be investing with this hand. These low pairs, when you have the betting lead and you get a good board, they do benefit just from getting random overcards to fold. Like imagine someone has Six Seven, bets and fold. That's great for us. And also on these connected boards, sometimes your opponent will call with a draw and draws will miss and maybe you'll be able to catch them bluffing. So we make a small bet."

**Turn (J♣):** "Of course we're going to check."

**River (8♠):** "So a bunch of draws hit, terrible situation for us. Our opponent fires a really tiny bet and here we have a tough decision. We only beat bluffs. Even though the bet is a small, a lot of them got there. There's still something like King Nine, King Queen, maybe some Ace high that's bluffing. But it's tough to figure out what we beat unless our opponent is betting somehow with Fours."

**Result:** "We decide to make a crying call and run into the magic King Nine to win. But could easily have seen a fold there."

### Hand 4: Defending Big Blind with Pocket Fives

**Preflop:** "We defend the big blind with Fives."

**Flop (8♥ Q♥ 7♠):** "We miss, Queen Seven Eight. So we're basically looking to show down and walk the leap for us."

**Turn (A♣) and River (Q♠):** "We do."

"So, yeah. Of course a lot of the time you're just going to be folding with these hands. I don't have a folding one in this database, but I'll mention what would need to happen for us to fold."

### Hand 5: BvB with Pocket Deuces - Turning into a Bluff

**Preflop:** "We raise BvB, get re-raised and we call Deuces."

**Flop (K♦ A♠ 6♥):** "Ace King Six. And here when we check, had our opponent bet, we would fold."

**Turn (9♠):** "And on the turn, if he bets we'll fold."

**River (8♠):** "And on the river we have a bluff-catcher and we might call or fold and we actually decide to turn Deuces into a bluff. This is how weak the hand is on this kind of board where really we're hoping he folds a Six or Sevens or something."

**Result:** "And we get called by King Ten."

"So yeah, pocket pairs very often like this."

### Hand 6: Button with Pocket Fours - The Big Win

"I'll give you guys one where we win a nice hand."

**Preflop:** "This one here we raise the button, get re-raised and we call."

**Flop (T♦ 7♥ 4♣ rainbow):** "And a magic Four Seven Ten rainbow board. Our opponent fires a huge bet. I'd never ever raised Fours here. It's just an invulnerable hand. If you want to fast play, do it with something that is not the nuts on every single turn in the deck. The effective nuts. So always call this hand here, it's so easy to put the money in."

**Turn (7):** "So we now has our hand improved. I mean, we now have open-enders drawing dead, I guess. Our opponent bets and again we call with our nuts, the effective nuts."

**River (K):** "He shoves, we call and we win a nice hand against pocket Jacks."

"And our opponent was actually playing it okay. Remember, we often have much weaker hands here. It's not that easy to have a strong hand, but yeah, when pairs hit, they tend to win big."

## Key Takeaway

"So you guys kind of saw the story of pairs in this video where it's a lot of awkward small pots or folding if your opponent ever bets, maybe you turn it into a bluff... Really tough to get anything going, and then suddenly you win a huge one."
