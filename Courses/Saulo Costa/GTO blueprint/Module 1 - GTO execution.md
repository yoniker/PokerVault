## 1.1 Pseudo GTO execution

I'll get a framework of how to execute pseudo-GTO.
We can't play perfectly balanced - but we can get close to it.

What does it mean to play GTO? It means to play an unexploitable strategy.
The assumptions of GTO are:
1. Opponent is clairvoyant (=know exactly my entire strategy)
2. Opponent is perfectly adaptable (no matter what I do, he can maximally exploit it)
This GTO opponent is the NEMESIS (a term taken from the book "the mathematics of poker"), a really scary opponent, he's perfect.

However, my opponent is NOT the nemesis, it's a human. So why do I need GTO strategies?
The main reason is because I can then become an excellent expoliter - once I see how balance looks like, I will be able to identify leaks in my opponents' strategy.
Other reasons are - on nodes that are very frequent (preflop/flop and some turns), maybe I don't want to play exploitative strategies, or when I play vs someone who is better than me, or when someone countered my exploits and now I want to revert back to balanced play.

So- How do we do it?
