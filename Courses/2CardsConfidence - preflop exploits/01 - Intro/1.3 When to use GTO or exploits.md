# GTO vs. Exploits: A Practical Guide

## The Core Question: Which Approach Should We Use?

> So when we're playing, which of these approaches should we use and at which situations? GTO or exploit? When does which make sense to apply in game?

## 1. The GTO Approach: Your Defensive Baseline

### When to Use GTO:
The GTO approach makes sense when you have **no reliable information** about your opponent.

> This makes sense to use when you don't have any reads or data on your opponent and you don't know what their weaknesses are... That could be the case when your opponent is completely unknown... or they are just so good that you haven't been able to figure out any weaknesses that they have.

### Pros and Cons of GTO:
> **Pro:** It's a solid strategy which can't be exploited... it's the best defense strategy against someone that is unknown because you will not lose any money if you apply it correctly.
>
> **Con:** You will leave money on the table in any case that your opponent is not playing GTO... That will make you less money than if you fully attack their weaknesses.

## 2. The Exploit Approach: Maximizing Profit

There are two main types of exploitative strategies.

### Type 1: Specific Player Exploits

This is your top priority when you have reliable information.

> The first exploit is exploiting a specific player. So if you're playing one player and you know exactly what their tendencies are... you can exploit that and make a lot of money... This will always be your first priority.

#### Pros and Cons of Specific Exploits:
> **Pro:** This is the highest EV possible that you can make against any player because you are exploiting their specific weaknesses to the max.
>
> **Cons/Challenges:**
> *   **Data Gathering:** You first have to gather the reads or have some data which usually requires a lot of attention.
> *   **Sample Size:** You need some sample size because you can't just judge somebody and know exactly what they're playing like when you have just played 10 hands against them.
> *   **Imperfect Data:** This data will never be perfect... you will only be able to see some hands that they took to showdown. From that you will have to extrapolate a strategy... which is always going to be only an estimation.

### Type 2: Population Exploits

This is a middle-ground approach for attacking the tendencies of an entire player pool.

> What that means is that you don't exploit a specific player, but you're going to focus on a complete pool, analyze the data from many players... and then build an exploit strategy against the average player of a large player pool.
>
> You can use it against unknown players whenever they are in a specific player pool.

#### Pros and Cons of Population Exploits:
> **Pro:** This is obviously going to be higher EV than playing GTO, because GTO is not attacking weaknesses at all.
>
> **Pro:** The sample size is much more attainable... because every player in that pool contributes to the data and you don't need a large sample size on one specific player.
>
> **Con:** You are not exploiting a specific player so the profits will be less than in the example before where we maximally exploit a specific opponent.

## 3. The Hierarchy of Strategy

This is the order of operations you should follow at the table.

> 1.  **Specific Player Exploits:** If you have specific data against a specific opponent, you will always want to set that as the first priority.
>
> 2.  **Population Exploits:** If you don't have that, then you want to rely on pool data and apply exploit strategies that you have worked out against a specific pool.
>
> 3.  **GTO Strategy:** And if you don't have that, then you can always fall back to the GTO strategy. Use that against anybody you don't have any reads at all and at least make sure that you will not be getting exploited yourself.

## 4. Course Outline: What We Will Cover

> So the goal is to equip you with all of these in this course, which is why we will:
>
> 1.  **Cover the GTO approach** of a 500 NL rake structure on PokerStars.
>
> 2.  **Focus on Population Exploits** by going over my own database in the PokerStars Mid-Stakes player pool... and see exactly how the average PokerStars regular plays, so that we can then... calculate exploits against them.
>
> 3.  **Cover Specific Player Exploits.** We're going to look at player examples that are playing too tight or too loose in certain situations, and we're going to see how we would counter that in the best way possible.
