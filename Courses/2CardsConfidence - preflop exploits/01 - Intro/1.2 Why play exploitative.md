My summary- he just played with HRC pro and showed that while playing GTO vs opponents which deviate is profitable, adjusting my strategy to their deviation is even more profitable (although to be fair, the max-exploit strategy of shoving 80% range and raising top 5% hands and balancing it with the worst hands is simply ridiculous).
# The Power of Exploitative Play: A Deeper Dive

## 1. Defining the Core Concepts: GTO vs. Exploits

### What is GTO?

> GTO... It's a defensive strategy that doesn't lose money against any other strategy. This means that no matter how your opponent plays—if they play to lose, if they play too tight—you're gonna be making money if you play GTO. And if your opponent plays perfectly, so they play GTO as well, you don't lose any money, which is a pretty convincing strategy.

> If you play GTO and your opponent also plays GTO, none of you guys will make money. Neither of you will lose anything, but neither of you will win anything. But as soon as one of you guys deviates from GTO, the person who plays GTO will make money from the other one.

### What is an Exploit?

> One step above that is the exploit, which means that you actively counter-attack your opponent's imperfect play. You adjust your strategy, you don't play GTO yourself anymore, and you actively attack your opponent's weaknesses. And that, in return, makes you even more money than playing GTO against such a suboptimal strategy from your opponent.

## 2. Proving the Concept: A Simulation Analysis

> We can prove that by looking at a few simulations. This is a GTO simulation that I've run in HRC, which is Hold'em Resources Calculator, a preflop simulation software.
>
> All of the ranges that we will look at in this course, GTO and exploitative, have been run by me in HRC. This is a GTO preflop simulation for a 6-max game, 100 big blinds deep, NL500. We are gonna look at a spot: button versus big blind.

### The Three Scenarios Tested:

The goal is to run three simulations that resemble these scenarios:
1.  **GTO vs. GTO:** Our strategy on the button is GTO, and the Big Blind's is also GTO.
2.  **GTO vs. Non-GTO:** We keep our GTO strategy on the button, but we alter the Big Blind's strategy to be imperfect (e.g., 3-betting too much).
3.  **Exploit vs. Non-GTO:** We allow our strategy on the button to adjust and calculate the perfect *exploit* against the Big Blind's imperfect strategy.

## 3. The Simulation Results

### The Baseline: GTO vs. GTO

> On average, we will win **0.172 big blinds** whenever we are on the button and can open the raise. And what we want to do now is compare that EV in this scenario with the EV in the other scenarios.

### Scenario A: Opponent is Too Loose (Over 3-Bets)

First, we adjust the Big Blind's 3-betting frequency from the GTO 13.2% up to 20.1%.

**Result 1: Playing GTO vs. the Loose Opponent**
> So we haven't changed our strategy on the button but our opponent has, and as he has deviated from a GTO strategy... this has now resulted in us making more money on average.
>
> The EV is now at **0.19 big blinds** on average, which is higher than before. This would mean a **1.6 big blinds per 100** increase in win rate. This is not bad of course, but it's not incredible.

**Result 2: Playing an Exploitative Strategy vs. the Loose Opponent**
Now, we allow our button strategy to adjust to the Big Blind's looseness.
> Now the ranges reacting to the three-bet have changed... the solver would almost shove our entire range against the three-bet, which in theory makes sense, of course, because the big blind is three-betting way too much.
>
> We can see that EVs have gone up to **0.301**... which is a difference of 0.114 big blinds on average. So way more than before. This is actually **11.4 big blinds per hundred more** than the simulation before.

### Scenario B: Opponent is Too Tight (Under 3-Bets)

Next, we change the Big Blind's 3-betting frequency to a much tighter 6.7%.

**Result 1: Playing GTO vs. the Tight Opponent**
> The EV has gone up a little bit, really just a little bit... This is actually just **0.001 big blinds more**. So only 0.1 big blinds per 100 more in this case.

**Result 2: Playing an Exploitative Strategy vs. the Tight Opponent**
Again, we allow our strategy to adjust.
> If you're facing a 6.7% 3-betting range, you should be playing really tight against that... you can see that the solver would fold almost all of these broadway hands, almost all medium and small pocket pairs, even Ace-Queen off.
>
> The EV would have gone up to **0.2**... which is an increase of **2.7 big blinds per hundred** going from GTO versus non-GTO to exploitative to non-GTO.

## 4. Key Takeaways

> Both scenarios should have proved by now that the power of exploiting can yield you a lot more money than just sticking to GTO whenever your opponent is playing a non-GTO strategy themselves.

### Why learn to play exploitatively?

> 1.  **It's More Profitable:** Just playing GTO is a good strategy but not the best. You will be missing out on all the additional EV and money that you can make by adjusting your strategy to your opponent's weaknesses.
>
> 2.  **It Makes You a Better Player:** Actively looking for weaknesses and finding ways to exploit people will improve your understanding as a poker player to incredible extents, instead of just grinding down the GTO strategy.
>
> 3.  **It's More Fun
