# GTO vs. Exploitative Play: An Introduction

## The Common Scenario: Facing a 3-Bet

> We all know the situation. You play your regular games, you open the button and get 3bet. Maybe you've studied GTO preflop ranges before, which is great, and you know exactly which hands to continue according to GTO. But maybe you haven't and that's why you're here. Also good.

## GTO Theory vs. Player Pool Reality

> For this spot, button vs big blind, these are the GTO ranges. The button would open around 43%, the big blind would 3bet around 13% and now we would continue with around 40% of our range and fold 60%. Great.
>
> However, this is how the average regular and an actual player pool would play their big blind. Which is quite a difference.

## The Exploitative Adjustment

> The best strategy for us on the button would look a lot differently when we face a 3bet. In fact, we would want to play a lot tighter. We would only want to continue less than 30% of hands now and a lot of hands we would otherwise call or raise now become clear folds.
>
> Since the average player not only 3-bets fewer hands than GTO suggests, but also 3-bets different hands on average, a lot of hands that would be profitable continuous for us on the button now become unprofitable and just want to be folded.

## Why Deviate From a "Perfect" Strategy?

> But I thought GTO was always supposed to be unexploitable. So why would playing GTO ranges become unprofitable?
>
> Well it's not that playing the ranges becomes unprofitable, they are still +EV. However if we know that someone plays a strategy that deviates from an unexploitable GTO strategy themselves, that means we can exploit them. Which is exactly what playing these ranges would be.
>
> By playing GTO ranges we don't play -EV, but we do miss out on winning a whole lot more money. We want to punish their mistakes to the max and exploit them. That is what playing the exploit ranges is.
