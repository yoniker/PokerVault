My summary: 
He explained that since regs are multi-tabling, they won't notice, and also, I can go with softer exploits like changing frequencies and not the distribution of hands etc.
# How to Exploit Without Becoming Exploitable

## The Big Question

> So what about being exploitable? Whenever I deviate from GTO, will I not make myself exploitable to others and be vulnerable to their attacks countering my approach of exploiting them?

## The Reality of Online Poker

The short answer is yes, in theory, you become exploitable. However, the reality is different.

> In practice, first of all, most people will not even notice your adjustments, as long as you're not making them super obvious. So most people, especially regulars, don't only play one table, they are multi-tabling, they are not paying as much attention as they should, so most exploits will probably not even get noticed.

## 4 Principles for Making Subtle, Undetectable Adjustments

Here are some best practices you can implement to make your adjustments less obvious.

### 1. Avoid Extreme Adjustments

Don't make changes that are immediately obvious. A theoretical "perfect" exploit might be too transparent in practice.

> Stay away from extreme adjustments... In the next chapter, we will witness some extreme adjustments that the solver would make, which include... open raising your complete range. And while that is a good approach in theory, this is something that people will pick up on much more easily.

### 2. Adjust Frequencies, Not Bet Sizes

Changing *how often* you do something is much harder to spot than changing *what* you do.

> Adjusting your frequencies instead of your bet sizes... If you imagine going from a 40% open raise frequency on the button... to a 60% open raise frequency, that will not get picked up on immediately. However, if you switch your bet sizing from 2.5 big blinds to 3 big blinds... it only takes one instance for your opponent to notice the difference.

### 3. Adjust Your Hand Distribution Logically

When widening a range, increase the frequency of hands that are already plausible in that range, rather than adding completely new, unexpected hands.

> You will be better off increasing the frequencies of hands that are usually a three-bet according to GTO anyway, instead of adding other hands which would not be... For example, three-betting four-five suited with a hundred percent frequency... will get detected less often than adding a hand like six-four suited which would never be a three-bet according to GTO.

### 4. Choose Your Spots Wisely

Adjustments made in less frequent situations are much harder for opponents to notice.

> The less often a spot occurs, the more difficult for your opponent it is to spot that you're adjusting... A difference in opening ranges will get picked up on much earlier than if you adjust your four-betting ranges.

## The Big Picture: Why You're Safer Than You Think

Even with mass data analysis, your adjustments will likely be masked by the different ways you play against different opponents.

> Most of your exploits will not really show in the data because you will also adjust your play according to certain players. So against some people you will 3-bet more, but against other people you will 3-bet less. So in the mass data, it will not show immediately that you're adjusting your strategy to an extreme extent.

### The Final Word

> So all of this just to say that you don't need to be afraid of being instantly counter-exploited whenever you go for exploits yourself.
