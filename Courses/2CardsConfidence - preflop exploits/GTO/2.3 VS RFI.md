# Why Solved Preflop Ranges Are Essential (Even in an Imperfect World)

## The Common Objection

A frequent argument against using solver-calculated ranges is that they are flawed.

> The objection is that they are based on solvers. And solvers calculate ranges based on the assumption that players play perfectly postflop. But since that is not the case in reality, the argument is that the solver calculated ranges are not valuable in practice against real players who play imperfectly postflop.

## The Rebuttal: Poker is a Game of Estimation

This objection misses a fundamental truth about the game. Perfect information is impossible, so we must rely on the best possible estimations.

> Poker is a game of estimation. Almost nothing in poker is 100% certain. You don't know your opponent's hand, so you have to estimate their range. You estimate how many value hands they have, how many bluffs they have.

## Exploitative Ranges are a *Better* Estimation

Even if not perfect, an exploitative range is a more accurate starting point than a GTO range when you have data on your opponents' tendencies.

> Estimating opponents' preflop tendencies... is simply a **better estimation** than assuming they play GTO preflop.
>
> So yes, solver calculated exploit ranges are not a perfect representation, but they are **way closer to it than GTO ranges.**

## The Real Lesson: Understand the *Direction*, Not Just the Range

The goal is not to blindly copy charts, but to understand the principles behind the adjustments.

> The best players understand that knowing in which direction to adjust is the name of the game, not which exact strategy to land on. And that's what I want you to take away here.
>
> **Don't just go ahead and copy all the ranges you see... but view them as a guideline** for which positions allow you to be more aggressive and which you need to be tighter in... You want to understand **how you can deviate and why**, instead of blindly copying. That's what exploiting is all about.

## The Hidden Value: A Postflop Advantage

Understanding preflop exploits gives you a more accurate picture of your opponent's range on the flop, which is a massive advantage.

> Learning exploitative preflop ranges... is extremely valuable... because they are not only preflop ranges. **They are also flop ranges.**
>
> If you have a good understanding of which hands your opponents play preflop, you also know which ranges they get to the flop with... Having a better idea of the ranges players get to the flop with will allow you to outplay them way more effectively than just assuming they play GTO ranges.
