# Part 2 (GTO): Introduction & User Guide

## What This Section Covers

This section of the course establishes the Game Theory Optimal (GTO) baseline that will serve as a reference for later modules on exploitative play.

> So as explained earlier we will start with the GTO section and I will go over the GTO ranges for this scenario which is in this example going to be a NL500 PokerStars reg structure, and this simulation will work as a reference for all GTO ranges we will look at in later sections.

## Which Path Should You Take?

This section is divided into two versions to suit your current knowledge level. You also have the option to skip it entirely.

### 1. The Extensive Version (For a Deep Dive)

This is the comprehensive path, recommended for anyone who is not fully comfortable with GTO preflop concepts.

> **Who is this for?**
> > If you're not too familiar with the GTO preflop ranges yet or feel like you haven't understood everything yet, then this one will be for you.
>
> **What does it cover?**
> > I will be going over every or nearly every range in the tree and explain everything around it... I will be going over the raise first in ranges, the reaction against open raises, reactions against three bets and reactions against four bets and will be covering everything in detail.

### 2. The Short Version (For a Quick Refresher)

This is a condensed overview designed to get everyone on the same page before moving on to exploits.

> **Who is this for?**
> > If you already know that and only need a refresher of the GTO ranges, then I suggest you to watch the short version of the GTO approach, which is the last video in this chapter.
>
> **What does it cover?**
> > I am just going over most of the ranges and explaining them in short, just so that we are all on the same page when we will be covering the population approach and individual player tendencies at a later point.

### 3. Skipping This Section (For the Experts)

If you are already confident in your GTO knowledge, you can proceed directly to the next part of the course.

> **Who is this for?**
> > If you overall feel comfortable with GTO ranges anyway and you think you don't even need a refresher, then of course feel free to just skip the GTO section overall.
>
> **Recommendation:**
> > I would advise you to at least have a look at the short version, but still if you don't want to do that then that's perfectly fine and you can skip right ahead to the population analysis and I'll see you there.
