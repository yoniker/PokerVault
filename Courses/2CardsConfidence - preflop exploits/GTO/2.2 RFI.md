# GTO Basics: Preflop Opening Ranges

## Opening Ranges by Position

This guide covers standard GTO opening ranges, moving from early to late position.

### Under the Gun (UTG)

> This is a very tight range with about **20%** of open raises.
> *   **Pairs:** Pocket fives and better (55+).
> *   **Offsuit:** KTo+.
> *   **Suited:** Every suited ace (A2s+), K5s+, Q9s+.
> *   **Suited Connectors:** Higher ones like 76s+, plus some 65s and 54s.

### Hijack (HJ)

> The percentage goes up to almost **24%**. The types of hands are basically the same, just that we extend our range in every direction.
> *   Adds hands like K5s, A9s, QTo, JTo, and Pocket Fours (44).
> *   Includes more suited connectors with higher frequencies.

### Cutoff (CO)

> It's already at **30%**. We add a few more aces, a few more suited connectors, and a few more lower queen-x and king-x hands.

### Button (BTN)

> This will increase even more, which is about a **43%** opening range... this range is obviously pretty wide.
> *   Includes a lot of suited connectors.
> *   Adds suited one-gappers like 75s, 97s, T8s.
> *   Even includes hands like J4s.

### Small Blind (SB)

> The small blind opening range... is very close to the button's but... about **1.5% more.**
> *   Basically includes hands like J4s+ and T5s instead of T6s.

## Key Principles & Takeaways

### 1. Focus on the Shape and Lowest Hands

It's more important to understand the structure of the ranges than to memorize every single combination perfectly.

> These ranges you just want to remember, just memorize as good as you can. Basically just try to remember the **lowest hands** that would open.
>
> It's just important that you know the **shape of these ranges** and that obviously the button will have a wider range... The under the gun range is less than half of those hands.

### 2. Hands to Avoid

Some hands are simply never profitable to open from any position.

> You basically never want to open any of these unconnected offsuit hands.
>
> Also, these suited hands which are very unconnected are never opened in any position.
