# GTO Guide: Reacting to an Open Raise

This guide explains how to react when facing a preflop open raise, covering different positions and the theory behind range construction.

## In-Position Play (Hijack & Cutoff)

For this simulation, the Hijack (HJ) and Cutoff (CO) do not have a calling range against an open raise; they either 3-bet or fold.

> Most of the time you just want to three bet from the hijack and the cutoff... The EV you get from adding flatting ranges in these positions... is comparably low.

### The Strategy: A Tight, Linear Range

When you are in position but haven't invested money (and other players are behind), your strategy is **linear**. This means you primarily 3-bet the strongest hands in your range.

> These ranges are all very linear... they basically only play the best hands possible, so all of these high cards and pocket pairs, and then like two hands that are more on the bluffing side.
>
> You're basically 3-betting everything that is good and folding everything that is worse.

## The Button: Adding a Calling Range

The Button is a special case because you are guaranteed to be in position postflop. This makes calling a much more attractive option.

> On the button you will be in position for the rest of the hand, so including a calling range adds quite more EV.
>
> What the solver wants to do is basically split a lot of the hands. We can see that all these... middling pocket pairs, even up to jacks, are basically calling and raising about 50-50.

## Out-of-Position Play (The Blinds)

### Small Blind: Tight and Linear

Like the HJ and CO, the Small Blind (SB) plays a tight, linear, 3-bet-or-fold strategy. You are out of position and don't want to get squeezed.

> For the small blind against the under the gun open we see that we 3-bet really tight. Only 7% of hands... The 3-betting range is really tight... even ace-queen off is folding most of the time.

### Big Blind: Wider and Polarized

The Big Blind (BB) is a completely different story. Because you have already invested one big blind and are last to act, you get great pot odds to see a flop. This leads to a **polarized** strategy.

> **Why you can play more hands:**
> > You already put in one big blind into the pot so you only need to call... only 1.2 additional big blinds to play the hand... You are basically safe to see the flop if you call your hand.
>
> **What is a Polarized Range?**
> > The 3-betting range is not linear... we want to 3-bet the best hands that we have, the very best hands like Aces, Kings, Ace-King... and the lower end of the spectrum which is... more bluffing hands.
>
> **Why Call with Medium-Strength Hands?**
> > Hands like Ace-Queen suited, Ace-Jack suited, and pocket Jacks... just prefer to call. They just elect to call and see the flop instead of allowing your opponent to come over the top for a bet and you being in a very bad spot.

## The Core Logic: Domination and Equity

The choice to call or 3-bet is not random. It's based on how your hand interacts with your opponent's likely range.

### Why You 3-Bet a "Bluff" (e.g., KTo vs. Button)

You 3-bet hands that can **fold out better hands that dominate you**. This is a massive EV win.

> A hand like King-10 off is very well served by three betting because... you fold out Ace-10 off... Folding out dominating hands because not only do you fold out a hand that is better than yours, you also play a part post flop where you have less hands that are dominating you.

### Why You Call a "Good Hand" (e.g., K9s vs. Button)

You call with hands that **dominate a large portion of the hands your opponent will continue with**.

> If instead you elect to call with those hands, you're keeping in all of the button's lower Kx hands which they would fold against the 3-bet... By calling... we are playing a pot post flop where we simply dominate a lot of our opponent's hands.

### The Final Takeaway:

> Always think about:
> *   **What does calling do for you?** Do you keep in dominated hands?
> *   **What does three betting do for you?** Do you fold out dominating hands?
