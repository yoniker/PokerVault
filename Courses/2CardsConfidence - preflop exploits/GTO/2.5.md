# GTO Guide: Reacting to a 4-Bet

This guide covers the GTO approach to facing a 4-bet, both in position and out of position.

## Part 1: In Position vs. a 4-Bet

When you have position, your primary decision is whether to call, jam (5-bet), or fold.

### Key Concept: Aces Call, Kings Jam

One of the most important GTO principles in 4-bet pots is how to play the strongest premium hands.

> **Aces basically always want to just flat.**
> > The reason for that is simply to keep in a lot of these bluffs that the under the gun player is going to have... if we have Aces and we jam, of course they're just going to fold. But if we go ahead and call... we are just going to get another c-bet in a lot of the time.
>
> **Pocket Kings basically always wants to jam here.**
> > The reason is simply that the difference between Kings and Aces is still pretty big because Aces can never flop an **overcard**... if we have Kings and we're up against our opponent's Ace-King, Ace-Jack bluffs... and the flop comes Ace-high, then our equity drops significantly. We're missing out on a lot of value if we simply call.

### The Value of Low Suited Connectors

Against very tight 4-betting ranges (which are heavy on high cards), low suited connectors perform surprisingly well.

> Low suited connectors perform really well against tight ranges... because there are so many high cards involved, low cards are going to be much more valuable than high cards.

### How Ranges Change with Position

As the initial positions get later (e.g., Button vs. Cutoff instead of Hijack vs. UTG), all ranges become wider.

> Ranges get wider the more we go into later positions... If we look at the button versus cutoff for example this is going to be even wider because again ranges are wider in the first place. So here we can actually call every King-x suited, Queen-x suited, Jack-Ten suited, even 9-10 suited.

## Part 2: Out of Position vs. a 4-Bet

When you are out of position (in the Small or Big Blind), your strategy must be even tighter, and your decisions change.

### The Small Blind: An Extremely Tight Spot

Facing a 4-bet from out of position is one of the toughest situations in poker. Your continuing range should be exceptionally narrow.

> This is one of the... tightest positions we can be in... For now, just remember very tight range: **Jacks-plus, Ace-Queen suited plus.** For the most part, [other suited broadways] are just going to fold.

### Why Aces Jam Out of Position

While Aces prefer to call when in position, they prefer to jam when out of position.

> In this case, being out of position is a little worse to play post-flop, which means that shoving Aces is going to perform a little better than just allowing our opponent to play the rest of the hand in position.

### The Big Blind

The Big Blind's reaction is similar to the Small Blind's but slightly wider as the opponent's ranges get wider.

> Against the button, this goes even wider... Ace-Queen off is going to be calling here. And basically, every suited broadway hand is good enough to call here... because the button's four-betting range... contains quite some offsuited Broadway hands.

### Final Takeaway:

Reacting to 4-bets requires a disciplined approach. In position, you can call more often, using your positional advantage to realize equity. Out of position, you are forced to play a much tighter, jam-or-fold strategy with the very top of your range.
