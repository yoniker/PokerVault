My summary:
SB 3-bets tigher than GTO vs EP and then they play very tight vs 4-bet(call less,5-bet less than GTO):
1. I can open wider
2. 4-bet a bit more often than GTO (polorized, all of our bluffs are Ax suited and Kx suited)
3. vs 5-bet jams continue only with KK+ and AK

#  Population Exploit (Early Position vs. Small Blind)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for Early Position when facing a Small Blind 3-bet.

## 1. Analysis: Small Blind Tendencies (vs. Early Position)

The "average" player in the Small Blind shows a clear trend: the earlier the open, the tighter they 3-bet.

-   **They 3-bet tighter than GTO:** Against early position, the small blind 3-bets less often than GTO. This is a contrast to late position battles where they were looser (vs. BTN) or similar (vs. CO).
-   **They react too passively to a 4-bet:** This is a consistent exploitable leak across all positions.
    -   **They call less:** Population calls a 4-bet only **~2.5%** of the time, while GTO calls more.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) less:** Population shoves only **~2%**, and they rarely 5-bet bluff with hands like A5s.

## 2. The Exploit: How Early Position Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Call Less, 4-Bet More

Because the Small Blind's 3-betting range is tighter, but their continuing range vs. a 4-bet is weak and passive, we adjust by 4-betting more frequently as a bluff.

> The trend continues here which is that **we can 4-bet more often.**
>
> In early position, you want to be 4-betting a little bit more often, especially 4-bet bluffing. And the later the position gets (Cutoff, Button), the more frequently you want to be 4-betting just to collect more of those folds.

### How to React When Facing a 5-Bet Jam

The population's 5-bet jamming range is extremely tight and value-heavy, with almost no bluffs. Our calling range must be exceptionally narrow.

> Whenever we do face a jam, we don't want to call anything that is not **pocket Kings, Aces or Ace-King.**
>
> Even [pocket Jacks] is not good enough to call. If we're facing a range that basically includes Jacks or better, then we don't want to call pocket Jacks, which just goes to show again how tight population really plays.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds we can open much wider. The profit comes from two key areas:

1.  The Small Blind is 3-betting less often, allowing us to see more flops.
2.  We get into the highly profitable 4-bet bluffing scenario more often.

> We could open much wider, **more than 10% more** than what would be GTO... Our profit from opening more hands comes from two scenarios. The first is actually that small blind would be three-betting less often. But the second one is again that we can get into the situation where we can 4-bet them more often and expect a lot more folds that way.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Early Position vs. Small Blind

> -   In Early Position, we'll see **fewer 3-bets** by the Small Blind than GTO, so we need to **call less hands.**
>
> -   However, as an exploit, we don't need to fold much more overall, but we can **4-bet more often** because population in the Small Blind not only calls less, but also 5-bets less against our 4-bet.
>
> -   So, whenever we do get jammed on, we're up against a very tight range and can only call **Ace-King, Kings, and Aces.**
>
> -   Optionally, you could also **open raise a much wider range** because of the Small Blind's lower 3-bet frequency.
