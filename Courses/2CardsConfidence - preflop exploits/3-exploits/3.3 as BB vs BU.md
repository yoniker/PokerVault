My summary: Since the NL500 pokerstars regs population call a lot compared to GTO and 4-bets much less, the exploit is to 3-bet a WAY MORE linear range than GTO suggests, and vs 4-bet play straightforward, and only continue with nuts (JJ+/AK).

# Part 3: Population Exploit (Big Blind vs. Button)

This section switches perspectives to analyze the exploitative strategy for the Big Blind when facing a Button open.

## 1. The Setup

> For that we are assuming a GTO opening range [for the Button] which means that population is opening close to what GTO would be... And I have then not locked the reaction by the button against the three-bet. And we can then see what the solver would suggest us to do as the big blind.

## 2. The Core Exploit: 3-Bet More Linearly

The maximum exploit strategy against a typical Button player is to shift our 3-betting range from **polarized** (GTO) to **linear**.

> The solver would suggest us to three-bet more linear. That means it would suggest us to three-bet hands like King-Jack suited, Queen-Jack suited all of the time... Not only the suited hands, but also King-Queen off, Ace-Jack off. Those would be hands that would be three-betting all the time.

### Why Does This Work?

There are two primary reasons why a linear 3-betting strategy is more profitable against the general player pool:

#### Reason #1: Population Under 4-Bets

The average player on the Button does not 4-bet as often as GTO suggests. This reduces the risk of 3-betting medium-strength hands that would have to fold to a 4-bet.

> We are getting four-bet less often by the real player pool. And for that reason, we can get away by three-betting more linear and we are not risking getting four-bet with those hands as often.

#### Reason #2: Population Over-Calls with Weak Hands

The average Button player calls 3-bets with many hands that are too weak and should be folded. This gives our linear range a significant domination advantage postflop.

> Population calls quite more often than what would be GTO... Hands like Queen-Eight suited, Jack-Eight suited, even suited one gappers like 9-7 suited... those would all be pure folds in GTO.
>
> If we know our opponent will call Jack-Eight suited all the time, which they shouldn't, then of course we can go ahead and three-bet King-Jack suited all the time.

## 3. How to React When Facing a 4-Bet

Because the population 4-bets less often and with fewer bluffs, their 4-betting range is extremely strong and value-heavy. Our response must be to play very tight.

> If we face a four-bet, we are facing a much tighter range than what would be GTO. And of course, what that means is **we want to fold much more often.**
>
> Population is for-betting less often with bluffs which means that we will be facing value much more often and then hands like King-Jack suited, King-Ten suited, Queen-Ten suited, Queen-Jack suited, **those just have to go against the four-bet.**

### Key Adjustments vs. a 4-Bet:

-   **Fold More:** Even strong hands like Ace-Queen off become a pure fold.
-   **Never Bluff-Jam:** You're not going to get as many folds as you would be in theory.
-   **Never Slow-Play Aces:** If your opponent's range is value-heavy, there's no point in slow playing. We might as well take advantage of stacking Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Ace-King right away.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Big Blind vs. Button

> -   We mainly want to **three-bet more linear**, as population likes to over-call and under four-bet when they'
> - 
> - re on the Button.
>
> -   We can exploit that by three-betting a lot more **value hands which dominate the Button's wider calling range** and don't have to fear being four-bet off their equity as much.
>
> -   When we do face a four-bet, however, we have to play **extremely tight** and even fold hands like Ace-Queen off and King-Jack suited, as the Button's four-betting range is just so strong.
>
> -   We also **never bluff-jam** and **never slow-play Aces**, contrary to what would be GTO.
