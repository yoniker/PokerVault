My summary:
They call more vs GTO vs a 3-bet (and 4-bet a little less) so I should actually 3-bet tighter (12.8% instead of 14.2%).

VS 4-bet, since they do infreuqently find 4-bet bluffs with ATo/AJo/AQo/KTo, 
I can jam TT+/AK and continue with the best suited broadways. Also I can jam with 77/66 sometimes.

# Population Exploit (Small Blind vs. Button)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Small Blind when facing a Button open.

## 1. Analysis: Button Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player on the Button deviates from GTO in several key ways when facing a 3-bet from the Small Blind.

-   **They call 3-bets *way* more often:** This is the most significant tendency. Population over-calls with a huge variety of hands that should be folds.
    > Hands like... Jack-Eight suited, King-Seven and lower suited hands, basically every suited Ace, and even some Ace-Ten off, King-Jack off... Even pocket Threes and pocket Deuces... are all being called way more often than what would be allowed in GTO.
-   **They 4-bet slightly less often:** Population is a bit more passive with their 4-bets, although they do find more 4-bet bluffs here than against the Big Blind.
    > Against the small blind, Button does find more 4-bet bluffs than against the big blind.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Small Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 3-Bet a Tighter, More Linear Range

Because the Button is calling our 3-bets so frequently, we must adjust by tightening up and using a more value-heavy, linear range. We want to have a stronger range on average when we see a flop, which will happen more often.

> We want to three-bet less, make our range tighter and go to the flop with a stronger range on average.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet

Since the Button's 4-betting range is slightly stronger and has fewer bluffs than GTO, we need to tighten up our continuing range.

-   **Call a selective range:** We can't continue as wide as GTO would. We want to fold all offsuit hands and continue with only the best suited broadways.
    > Just remember that you want to fold all of them and then continue with the best of those suited broadways.
-   **Jam more aggressively:** We can expand our value-shoving range to include hands like Tens and better, plus Ace-King. We can even mix in jams with lower pairs like Sevens.
    > We may actually jam pocket Sevens here. Sixes are also not a big mistake. And pocket Tens and better are basically the hands that we want to value-shove here. Ace-King as well.
-   **Slow-play Aces:** Because the Button *is* finding some 4-bet bluffs (unlike in other spots), slow-playing Aces by calling becomes a viable and profitable strategy again.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Small Blind vs. Button

> -   We can expect population to **call much more** and **4-bet only a little less** against our 3-bet. So, we want to **three-bet a tighter range.**
>
> -   Since the Button's 4-betting range includes fewer bluffs on average and is more linear, we exploit that by playing **tighter and calling less, but also jamming more aggressively.**
