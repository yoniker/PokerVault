my summary:
Population is opening CO tighter compared to GTO, and against population (given their poor response to 3-bet, despite their tighter open range) we want to 3-bet more often and call less often

vs a 3-bet, they fold more than GTO, that's why 3-betting is more profitable

against a 4-bet we continue similar combos to GTO

# Population Exploit: Button vs. Cutoff

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Button when facing an open from the Cutoff.

## 1. Analysis: Cutoff Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Cutoff exhibits several key tendencies that inform our exploitative counter-strategy.

-   **They open a tighter range:** Population opens from the Cutoff with a tighter range than GTO would suggest.
-   **They over-fold to 3-bets:** This is the most significant exploitable leak. They fold to a 3-bet from the Button more often than theory suggests.
    > The calling range here is only 9%, whereas in GTO that would be more than 11% of hands... Population just folds these most of the time.
-   **Their 4-bet frequency is similar to GTO:** Unusually, the population 4-bets at a rate very close to GTO, and they find a decent number of bluffs.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Button Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 3-Bet More, Call Less

Because the Cutoff is over-folding to 3-bets, our primary adjustment is to become more aggressive by 3-betting a wider range of hands. We shift many of our GTO calling hands into our 3-betting range.

> We would want to **three-bet more often.**
>
> We just want to be three-betting almost all hands that we are continuing except for some of those suited Broadway hands [and] some medium to low pocket pairs.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Play a Similar Range to GTO

Since the population's 4-betting frequency and range construction are surprisingly close to GTO in this spot, our counter-strategy is also very similar to GTO.

> When we are facing a 4-bet, we can actually see that our approach... is actually pretty similar.
>
> The combos that we can continue are pretty much the same overall. Ace-Queen off here... then those medium to low suited connectors and pocket pairs pretty much can all be continued here.

### The Special Case: Slow-Playing Aces

Because the Cutoff *is* finding a reasonable number of 4-bet bluffs in this scenario, slow-playing our pocket Aces by calling becomes the most profitable play again.

> We see that the Cutoff would be finding enough bluff 4-bets in this case so that Aces would be a profitable slow-play here, which we haven't seen a lot before.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Button vs. Cutoff

> -   Playing on the Button, we'll face a **tighter opening range** by the Cutoff.
>
> -   Still, the Cutoff slightly **over-folds against the three-bet**. So, we can **raise more aggressively and call less** than in GTO.
>
> -   Against the four-bet, we can call a **similar range to GTO**. So all suited broadways, Ace-Queen off, Fives-plus and suited connectors.
