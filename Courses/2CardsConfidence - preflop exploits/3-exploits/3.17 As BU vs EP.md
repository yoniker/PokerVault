My summary:

Vs their tighter-than-GTO open range, we fold more, but we play close to 3-bet-or-fold strategy (we barely ever call).,so we 3-bet a bit more than GTO, and call almost nothing.  Why? Because vs a 3-bet they overfold,undercall, and under-4-bet. However, if there's a fish in the blinds, I should opt to call more and keep him in the game.

Vs a 4-bet, since he put more bluffs for population compared to other scenarios (ATs, KTs,QTs, JTs), his solution showed that we can continue with KQs/AQs/AJs, but I think that we can get rid of KQs/AJs.

# Population Exploit: Button vs. Early Position

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Button when facing an open from Early Position (Under the Gun/Hijack).

## 1. Analysis: Early Position Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in Early Position exhibits several key tendencies when facing a 3-bet from the Button.

-   **They open a tighter range:** Population opens from early position with a range (**~20%**) that is tighter than even a standard GTO UTG range.
-   **They over-fold to 3-bets:** This is the most significant exploitable leak. They fold to a 3-bet more often than GTO suggests.
-   **They 4-bet less often and with fewer bluffs:** Their 4-betting range is extremely value-heavy, lacking the bluffing hands (like suited Aces and Kings) that GTO would use.
-   **They call 3-bets with hands that are too weak:** Population will sometimes call with offsuit broadways (AJo, ATo, KJo) that should be folded.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Button Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 3-Bet More, Call Less

Because the early position player is over-folding to 3-bets, our primary adjustment is to become more aggressive. We shift many of our GTO calling hands into our 3-betting range.

> We can see that not only do we just fold all hands that would be a call in GTO but a lot of them actually go into a three-betting range... For example, Ace-Queen would be mixing in more calls than three-bets [in GTO]... those would be almost pure three-bets in this exploitative approach.

### Important Caveat: The Blinds Matter

Your decision to call or 3-bet on the Button is heavily influenced by the players in the blinds.

> If you know the blinds are playing a lot differently than GTO, for example, if there's a recreational in the blinds, they will probably not be squeezing as aggressively... Then, for example, you can definitely expand your calling range... and keep the recreational in the game which is always going to increase your EV.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Over-Fold

Since the early position 4-betting range is so strong and value-heavy, our primary adjustment is to fold a significant portion of our 3-betting range.

> As we've just covered this, population is not 4-bet bluffing enough... it's just more value-heavy. So what we have to do is we have to adjust our calling range, we want to call less hands... everything that is worse than [KQ suited] just has to go. Pocket Ten is a really bad hand to have in this case.

### What *Can* You Continue With?

-   **Value Jams:** We fast-play our premium value hands like Aces instead of slow-playing.
-   **Calls:** Our calling range consists of strong suited broadways (AQs, KQs, AJs), some medium pocket pairs, and **low suited connectors**, which perform well against tight, strong ranges.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Button vs. Early Position

> -   When we are on the Button and face an early position open, that range is on average **tighter than optimal**. So we **fold more hands** than in GTO.
>
> -   However, as the average regular **over-folds against three-bets**, we can even **three-bet a bit more often** while **calling much less.**
>
> -   As often seen before, when early position does 4-bet, we have to **fold more than in theory.** Those hands are mostly low suited broadways and medium-to-low pocket pairs.
