My summary:
Population opens tighter than GTO (even EP), 4-bets less and calls more,
so again I want to have a more linear 3-betting range, but the same percentage as GTO since they don't 4-bet enough.

Against a 4-bet I want to fold literally everything that is not super-premium, fold AKo,continue with KK+ and AKs, QQ is indifferent in that scenario(!), JJ folds pure.
#  Population Exploit (Big Blind vs. Early Position)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Big Blind when facing an open from Early Position (combining Under the Gun and Hijack).

## 1. Analysis: Early Position Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in Early Position deviates from GTO in several key ways, which informs our exploitative counter-strategy.

-   **They open tighter:** Population opens a much tighter range from early position than GTO suggests. The combined UTG/HJ opening range is even tighter than a standard GTO UTG range.
-   **They call 3-bets more often (relatively):** Because their opening range is so tight, even if they call the same absolute number of hands, they are calling a higher percentage of their range.
-   **They 4-bet MUCH less often:** Population 4-bets only **~1.5%**, while GTO would be around **2.5%**.
-   **Their 4-betting range has far fewer bluffs:**
    > All of these King-x suited hands... are basically never being 4-bet. Medium and low suited Aces are in there sometimes but to a much lesser extent than in theory... Overall population is 4-betting much more straightforward and there are a lot less bluffs involved.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Big Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Call Tighter, 3-Bet More Linearly

-   **Call less often:** Since we are facing a tighter opening range, our calling range must also tighten up. The exploit is to call **~25%** of hands, compared to the GTO **28%**.
-   **3-bet a more linear range:** Because our opponent is under 4-betting, we can get away with 3-betting more value-oriented, medium-strength hands without fear of being blown off our equity.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: An Extreme Fold

This is the most critical takeaway. The population's 4-betting range from Early Position is so incredibly strong and devoid of bluffs that we must fold nearly everything.

> Whenever we do face a 4-bet as the big blind we just want to **fold everything which is not premium.** So in this case it's really extreme.
>
> We would even be folding **Ace-King off** here, even most of **pocket Queens**.
>
> **Pocket Jacks** [are a] full frequency fold.

### Why is Folding AKo Not a Blunder?

It might feel weak to fold a hand as strong as Ace-King off, but against a range this strong, it is the correct, solver-approved play.

> Folding Ace-King off here is not a blunder. It's not too weak. It is actually solver-proofed if we assume these ranges are true, which the data clearly shows it is... Big Blind against Under the Gun or against Hijack ranges in practice are just extremely strong.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Big Blind vs. Early Position

> -   We can expect a **tighter opening range** by population than what would be optimal, and therefore we can **call less hands.**
>
> -   We don't need to three-bet much tighter, however, because population will **not 4-bet us often enough.** So we can again get away with three-betting a **more linear range.**
>
> -   When we do get 4-bet though, it is time to run. Population 4-bets so **nitty** that we **fold everything but pocket Queens and better and Ace-King suited.**
