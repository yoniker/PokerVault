My summary:
Population actually plays the BU more aggressively than GTO (3-betting more, calling a bit less, overall folding less), so we actually want to 4-bet a bit more and call a bit more compared to GTO.

Vs a 4-bet they fold more, so we want to 4-bet more with blocker hands with AQo/AJo/KQo.
Vs a jam, we can call off TT+/AK.

# Population Exploit: Cutoff vs. Button

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Cutoff when facing a 3-bet from the Button.

## 1. Analysis: Button Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player on the Button plays a more aggressive strategy against a Cutoff open than GTO would suggest.

-   **They 3-bet *more* often:** Population 3-bets **over 13%** of the time, while GTO is just under 12%. This is a sign of a more aggressive approach.
-   **They react differently to a 4-bet:**
    -   **They over-fold:** Population folds to a 4-bet more often than GTO. They are particularly likely to fold medium-strength hands like suited connectors and broadways (QJs, JTs, QTs).
    -   **They jam (5-bet) more often:** Population is more likely to 5-bet jam with a wider range of hands, including bluffs like A5s and even medium pocket pairs like nines and tens.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Cutoff Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Call More, 4-Bet More

Because we are facing a wider and more aggressive 3-betting range, our primary adjustment is to defend more hands, both by calling and 4-betting more often.

### Adjusting Your 4-Betting Strategy

Since the population is over-folding to 4-bets, we want to increase our 4-bet bluffing frequency. The best hands to use are those with good blocking effects.

> We see the trend going from choosing those suited... hands that would be four-bets in GTO to going more for the **offsuited region**.
>
> **Ace-Queen off** would be 4-bet every time. **Ace-Jack off** would be 4-bet much more often... also **King-Queen** is being 4-bet a little bit more often.
>
> Why? Because population will over-fold against the 4-bet... blockers do play a bigger role.

### How to React When Facing a 5-Bet Jam

Because the population is jamming a wider range of hands (including bluffs and medium pairs), we can widen our calling range vs. a shove.

> If you do happen to face a jam then in this case **pocket Tens will be good enough to call.** Not only because population will actually jam weaker hands as in pocket Nines or A5-suited, but also just because a lot of those Ace-King off and Ace-King suited hands will be in there enough to make calling pocket Tens... good enough.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds that we should actually play a **tighter range** from the Cutoff. This is a direct counter to the Button's more aggressive 3-betting.

> We actually want to play a tighter range. And that pretty much goes back to what we've seen before that the button will be three-betting much more often. And whenever we do face a more aggressive approach, we would just want to cut back on the hands we are starting with so that we don't have to fold and give up the pot too often.

An interesting part of this adjustment is opening more **offsuit Ace-x hands** to block a significant portion of the Button's 3-betting range.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Cutoff vs. Button

> -   We'll see population on the Button **3-bet more often** and call less than GTO.
>
> -   Against the 3-bet, we want to **call a few more hands and 4-bet more often.** Besides premiums, our best hands to do that with are merge hands like **Ace-Queen off, King-Queen off, and Ace-Jack off**, but also **suited King-x**.
>
> -   If you also want to adjust your opening range, your best exploit would be to **open tighter** to counter the Button's more aggressive 3-betting.
