My summary:
Population 3-bets more than GTO(!) and vs a 4-bet it folds more calls less and 5-bets less,
so the GTO's max-exploit response is range 4-bet. 2cardsconfidence is saying that if I use the max-exploit and go to showdown with my J6s then it will be obvious to villian and they will adjust so I should soft-exploit by increasing 4-bet frequency with hands that do it anyways.

vs 5-bet I can continue with TT+, AQs+ (this late-position loose configuration, they do go with 99 and have bluffs like A5s/A4s).

I want to open slightly tighter than GTO vs a sb which 3-bets more.
# Part 3: Population Exploit (Button vs. Small Blind)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Button when facing a Small Blind 3-bet.

## 1. Analysis: Small Blind Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Small Blind deviates from GTO in a way we haven't seen before: they become more aggressive.

-   **They 3-bet *more* often:** Population 3-bets **~15%**, while GTO is **~14%**. This is the first time we've seen the population play a looser 3-betting strategy.
    > Hands like 8x, T8s, 98s and other suited connectors are just being three-bet more often.
-   **They react too passively to a 4-bet:** This is the crucial mistake that opens the door for a massive exploit.
    -   **They call less:** Population calls a 4-bet only **5%** of the time, while GTO calls **~5.8%**.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) less:** Population shoves only **~3%**, while GTO shoves **3.5%**.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Button Should React

### The Maximum Exploit: 4-Bet (Almost) Your Entire Range

The combination of the Small Blind 3-betting too wide and then over-folding to a 4-bet creates a hugely profitable situation for us.

> The amounts of folds we can expect from the small blind when we four-bet [is] so big that **four-betting basically every hand is getting profitable.** The maximum exploit in this scenario would be to four-bet basically every hand you opened against a three-bet.

### Practical Application: A More Balanced Approach

While 4-betting 100% of your range is the *maximum* exploit, it's not practical or wise in a real game.

> Is that really a smart idea in reality? I would argue against that because if you go ahead and four-bet 7-4 suited and your opponent happens to see that... they just have an easy time picking up on your exploit and readjusting.
>
> **What I would do:** Just take a lot of these suited Broadway hands and go ahead and call them... And I would probably personally just let go of all of these most weak hands... And I would just fold those and then maybe sprinkle in a little bit more of these hands that would be GTO 4-bets (K9s, J8s, K6s, AJo, KJo).

### How to Play vs. a 5-Bet Jam

Because the population tends to 5-bet bluff less often and slow-plays more premium hands by calling, we can make a very confident call when we face a jam.

> Whenever we do face a jam, we can actually call **Tens-plus**. We can actually call **Ace-Queen suited** here just because population does tend to jam A5s, A4s... even pocket Nines, pocket Tens are in there.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range based *only* on the Small Blind's play, it suggests a surprising adjustment.

> In this case the solver would actually go with a **tighter approach**. So we would be opening a little bit fewer hands than what would be GTO, and that is just because we are getting three-bet a little bit more often.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Button vs. Small Blind

> -   We will see population in the **Small Blind 3-bet more often** than optimal.
>
> -   As we can expect them to largely **over-fold and under five-bet** against the 4-bet, the exploit approach would allow us to **4-bet our complete range.**
>
> -   You likely want to be more careful in practice, however, and only increase the frequencies of hands that mix in 4-bets in GTO.
>
> -   Only based on the Small Blind's play, you would want to **open a little tighter on the Button** because of population's looser three-betting range.
