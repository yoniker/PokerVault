My summary:

Population actually 3-bets similar to GTO but has a poor response vs a 4-bet.
Max expolit is to 1. open wider and 2. 4-bet wider (3 times the frequency of vs a GTO) than GTO, do it with a polar range with a lot of lower Ax suited/Kx suited/AJo/ KJo/KQo and premiums and call the playable hands like suited broadways,

and this is because vs a 4-bet they fold more (compared to GTO),call less and 5-bet-jam a bit less

# Part 3: Population Exploit (Cutoff vs. Small Blind)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Cutoff when facing a Small Blind 3-bet.

## 1. Analysis: Small Blind Tendencies (vs. a Cutoff Open)

The "average" player in the Small Blind plays a 3-betting range with a similar frequency to GTO, but they make a critical error after we 4-bet.

-   **3-bet Frequency is similar to GTO:** Population 3-bets at roughly the same rate as a GTO player would.
-   **They over-fold to 4-bets:** This is the key mistake. Population continues against a 4-bet far less often than GTO.
    -   **They call less:** GTO would call a 4-bet **~4.4%** of the time; population only calls **~3.3%**.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) slightly less:** GTO jams **2.7%**; population jams **~2.5%**.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Cutoff Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 4-Bet a Wide, Polarized Range

Because the Small Blind is over-folding to 4-bets, our maximum exploit is to dramatically increase our 4-betting frequency, using a polarized strategy.

> The exploitative approach is to **4-bet almost double the amount of hands we want to call.**
>
> We can see that this is basically a very **polar approach**. So those hands that are playing well post-flop, those just want to be calling, and the bottom of our range that we are continuing would be serving as a 4-bet, basically a 4-bet bluff.

### A Practical 4-Betting Strategy

This exploit is more applicable in-game than the Button vs. Small Blind scenario because it's not as extreme as 4-betting 100% of the time.

> This could actually be applied in practice. If you don't want to overdo it as much, then just cut back on some of these hands like those lower suited King-x... But also, if you want to capitalize even more and think your opponent is even a little bit weaker... then you can also take those hands which would be mixes here and just 4-bet them every time.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds that we can open much wider, not because the Small Blind folds to the open, but to get into the profitable 4-betting scenario more often.

> We could be opening a lot wider... because we do get into this scenario where we are able to exploit the Small Blind by 4-betting more often than in theory... Our money from the exploit wouldn't come directly from the Small Blind over-folding against an open raise, but more so from the scenario where they three-bet and they then over-fold against our four-bet.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Cutoff vs. Small Blind

> -   We will face a **similar three-betting range** by the Small Blind as in GTO.
>
> -   However, as population **over-folds against four-bets**, we can **4-bet more than three times as much** than what would be optimal.
>
> -   You could also **open close to 39% of hands** and get to that spot of exploiting the Small Blind's over-folding more often.
