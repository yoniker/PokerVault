My summary:
They 3-bet tighter than GTO (with a slightly different distribution of hands, less suited connectors and more blocker hands like AJo/ATo/KQo which almost don't exist in GTO).
Anyways, we continue a similar range to GTO.

vs a 5-bet shove we pure fold QQ, and continue only with KK+ and AKs.

# Population Exploit: UTG vs. Hijack

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for an Under the Gun (UTG) player when facing a 3-bet from the Hijack.

## 1. Analysis: Hijack Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Hijack exhibits several key tendencies when 3-betting against an UTG open.

-   **They 3-bet less often:** Population 3-bets **~7.5%**, while GTO would be over **8.5%**. This is likely because players sometimes choose to flat-call hands like suited broadways instead of 3-betting them.
-   **They react differently to a 4-bet:**
    -   **They over-fold:** They fold more hands to a 4-bet than GTO, particularly medium-strength suited broadways (AJs, ATs) and low suited connectors.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) more often with value:** They are more likely to 5-bet jam their premium value hands (Aces, Kings, Queens) rather than slow-playing them by calling, as GTO often does. They rarely, if ever, 5-bet bluff.

## 2. The Exploit: How UTG Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Play a Similar Range to GTO

Interestingly, because the population's tendencies balance each other out (they 3-bet tighter, but then over-fold to our 4-bets), our overall continuing range remains very similar to a standard GTO range.

> Overall, this is quite similar to what would be GTO. We can see that the folding range is pretty similar... also we continue 6.5% in this exploitative approach and in GTO that would be 6.8%.

### How to React When Facing a 5-Bet Jam: Fold Queens and AKo

This is the most critical and potentially surprising takeaway. Because the Hijack's 5-bet jamming range is so strong and devoid of bluffs, we must make some extremely tight folds.

> The solver in this case would say our exploit would be to **fold pocket Queens and even Ace-King off** here... Population is never shoving anything worse than pocket Queens. So if we have pocket Queens, we can only be up against Ace-King a small portion of the time... but much more frequently we will face pocket Kings and pocket Aces.

> Just remember here for us in reality when we are under the gun and we face a jam by the hijack just fold everything but **pocket Kings and better and Ace-King suited.**

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds we can open much wider (**~28%** vs. the GTO **19.4%**). This is profitable for two main reasons:

1.  **The Hijack 3-bets less often:** We get to see more flops and realize equity with a wider range of hands.
2.  **Blocker Effects:** By opening more offsuit Ace-x hands, we block a significant portion of the Hijack's 3-betting range, reducing the frequency with which we face a 3-bet in the first place.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for UTG vs. Hijack

> -   As UTG, we'll face a **tighter than GTO 3-bet** by population in the Hijack.
>
> -   However, we can call and even 4-bet a **similar to GTO range.**
>
> -   Against the 4-bet, population **doesn't call enough hands**. The bottom of their range is folded too often and the top of their range isn't slow-played enough.
>
> -   So against a jam, we can only call **Ace-King suited, Kings, and Aces.**
