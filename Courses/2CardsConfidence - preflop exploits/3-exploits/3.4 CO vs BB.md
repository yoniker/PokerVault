My summary: First, vs NL500 pool's reaction, GTO opens CO way wider.

#  Population Exploit (Cutoff vs. Big Blind)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for a Cutoff vs. Big Blind scenario, building on the concepts from the Button vs. Big Blind analysis.

## 1. Analysis: Big Blind Tendencies (vs. a Cutoff Open)

The "average" player in the Big Blind shows similar—but more extreme—tendencies against a Cutoff open compared to a Button open.

-   **They 3-bet less often:** Population 3-bets **7.5%**, while GTO is **9.1%**.
-   **Their 3-betting range is more linear:** Just like before, they tend to 3-bet stronger hands more often and under-bluff with medium-to-low suited hands.
-   **Their calling range is much tighter:** This is a key difference. GTO would call almost **33%** of the time, but the population's calling range is significantly tighter.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Cutoff Should React

Given the Big Blind's tighter and more linear 3-betting range, our exploitative adjustment is to play much tighter ourselves.

### The Core Adjustment: Fold a Lot More

> We are going to continue a much tighter range and we have to fold hands like **King-Ten suited**. Even all of these medium **Ace-x suited** hands cannot be continued... also those lower suited aces... are just being folded.
>
> Basically, anything below **pocket Eights**, you can just fold and not have to think about it twice.

### Adjusting Your 4-Betting Strategy

Because the Big Blind's 3-betting range is stronger and they are less likely to 5-bet bluff, our 4-bet strategy changes.

-   **We bluff less:** We don't have as much fold equity when we 4-bet, which means we want to decrease our bluffing 4-bets.
-   **Use "Bluff/Value" Hands:** Our best 4-bet "bluff" becomes **Ace-Queen off**. It serves as a blocker to premium hands but also dominates a large part of the Big Blind's 4-bet calling range.
    > Having this as a bluff/value four-bet is going to be our go-to play.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario: A Massive Exploit

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it identifies a huge opportunity for aggression due to the Big Blind's passivity.

> We can see that the solver would open **more than 50% of hands** here which is just indicative of how off this range is that the big blind is playing...
>
> Why? Because we are in the cutoff, we are just facing folds much more often. We can collect the pot and that means in theory we would be allowed to open raise much more often and take advantage of that.

### How to Play After Opening Wide

> When we have opened such a wide range and we do face the three-bet, then we don't have to mind that we over-fold... Our exploit is in collecting the money whenever the Big Blind folds... we can just fold all of these hands that we opened additionally and we can just continue with basically the same range that we would be if we had been opening a GTO range.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Cutoff vs. Big Blind

> -   We again witness a **tighter and more linear three-betting approach** by population in the Big Blind. But in this case, they also **call less often** against an open.
>
> -   Against the three-bet, we have to **tighten up a lot** as population's frequency is so much lower than GTO's.
>
> -   And again, we **four-bet bluff rarely**, mainly choosing **Ace-Queen off** as a hand that blocks premium hands but also dominates the Big Blind's calling range.
>
> -   As population is so much **nittier** in the Big Blind... we could open **more than 23% more hands** in the Cutoff than a GTO opening range.
