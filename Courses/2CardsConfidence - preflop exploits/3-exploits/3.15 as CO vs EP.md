My summary:
While they do open a bit tighter than GTO, vs a 3-bet they 4-bet less, so overall I want a similar range compared to GTO (maybe slightly tighter).

VS a 4-bet, the only suited broadway i continue with is AQs (and sometimes JTs), all other suited broadways are being folded, JJ are indifferent, overall we need to overfold compared to GTO.

# Population Exploit: Cutoff vs. Early Position

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Cutoff when facing an open from Early Position (Under the Gun/Hijack).

## 1. Analysis: Early Position Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in Early Position exhibits several key tendencies when facing a 3-bet from the Cutoff.

-   **They open a tighter range:** Population opens from early position with a tighter range (**~20%**) than GTO would suggest.
-   **They 4-bet less often and with fewer bluffs:** This is a consistent theme. Population 4-bets only **~3.7%** of the time, while GTO is around **4.7%**. Their range is heavily weighted towards value.
    > Population basically almost never 4-bets those low suited connectors... Also the bluffs overall are just less in practice. So Ace-Queen off would be 4-betting much more often [in GTO].

## 2. The Exploit: How the Cutoff Should React

### The Core Adjustment (vs. an Open): 3-Bet Slightly Tighter

Because we are facing a tighter opening range from early position, our 3-betting range should also tighten up slightly in response.

> We want to be three-betting tighter than what would be GTO.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Over-Fold

Since the early position 4-betting range is so strong and value-heavy, our primary adjustment is to fold a significant portion of our 3-betting range, especially medium-strength suited broadways.

> When we as the Cutoff do face a 4-bet, again **we have to be folding much more often.** We can only continue Ace-Queen suited all the time. Other suited broadways just have to be folded. And the same goes for pocket Ten, pocket Nine, even most of pocket Jacks.

### What *Can* You Continue With?

-   **Calls:** The hands that perform best as calls against this tight 4-betting range are **low suited connectors**, which have good equity and playability.
-   **5-Bet Jams:** We want to fast-play our premium value hands.
    > In this case as well, that is also an argument for **fast-playing Aces** instead of slow-playing which would be GTO. So just get it in here and stack those hands that are 4-betting a lot.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Cutoff vs. Early Position

> -   We see population **raising tighter** than optimal from early position, which means we want to **3-bet a bit tighter** as well.
>
> -   The average reg **4-bets a lot more value hands and less bluffs**.
>
> -   So as a counter, we want to **fold almost all suited broadways** instead of calling them.
>
> -   At the same time, we do want to **fast-play all Ace-King off, Kings, and Aces.**
