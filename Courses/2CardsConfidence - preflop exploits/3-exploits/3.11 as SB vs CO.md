My summary: they open tighter and call more compared to GTO vs a 3-bet (and 4-bet less) so I want to 3-bet them with  a slightly tighter range than GTO (and linear)
Against a 4-bet, since they 4-bet a super-tight range, JJ is indifferent(!), I can continue with AQs or better/QQ

#  Population Exploit (Small Blind vs. Cutoff)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Small Blind when facing a Cutoff open.

## 1. Analysis: Cutoff Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Cutoff exhibits several key tendencies when facing a 3-bet from the Small Blind.

-   **They open a tighter range:** Population opens from the Cutoff slightly tighter than GTO suggests.
-   **They call 3-bets more often:** This is a recurring theme. They are more passive and prefer to see a flop rather than 4-bet.
-   **They 4-bet less often and with fewer bluffs:**
    > 3.3% is what population is actually 4-betting [compared to GTO's 4%+]. We can see that the trend tends to go for less 4-bet bluffs... A7 suited, King-Nine, King-Ten suited... those are just being 4-bet less often for population. So we are facing more 4-bets from value hands.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Small Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 3-Bet a Tighter Range

Because we are facing a tighter opening range to begin with, and our opponent is more likely to call our 3-bet, our best exploit is to tighten up our 3-betting range.

> We also want to be three-betting tighter. So a little bit more than 9% would be our best exploit approach. Just making sure that we don't overdo it against a strong range. So Ace-Jack off for example, even King-Queen off would not be a three-bet.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Over-Fold

Since the Cutoff's 4-betting range is so strong and value-heavy, our primary adjustment is to fold a significant portion of our 3-betting range.

> We should be folding much more hands... Ace-Queen suited is basically the only suited Broadway hand that we can continue full frequency. Most others are being folded... even **pocket Jacks are a fold here most of the time.**
>
> In reality, population just really plays extremely tight with everything regarding 4-bets, whether it's calling 4-bets or 4-betting themselves.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Jam Only for Value

With our opponent's range being so strong, there is no room for 5-bet bluffing. Our shoving range should consist only of premium value hands.

> We don't want to ever five-bet jam any hands that are not value. So A5-suited, don't go ahead and five-bet bluff it... This is not going to get through because players will just not fold a lot. Instead, you want to be five-bet jamming value and only value: **pocket Kings and pocket Aces as well as Ace-King off.**

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Small Blind vs. Cutoff

> -   Population will open the Cutoff a bit **tighter than GTO**. And combined with population **calling a three-bet more often**, we will have to **three-bet tighter.**
>
> -   Also, population **4-bets less bluffs** than they should. So we can exploit them by **over-folding quite a lot** against four-bets.
>
> -   We also **never bluff-jam**, but only shove value hands such as **Queens and better and Ace-King.**
> -
