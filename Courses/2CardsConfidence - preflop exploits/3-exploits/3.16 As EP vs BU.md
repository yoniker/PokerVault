My summary:
Population as the BU calls a bit less and 3-bets a bit less, but overall our response vs their 3-bet is very similar to GTO (almost identical) in terms of frequencies. Why? because vs a 4-bet they continue with a tighter range compared to GTO

# Population Exploit: Early Position vs. Button

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for Early Position when facing a 3-bet from the Button.

## 1. Analysis: Button Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player on the Button plays slightly more passively against an Early Position open than GTO would suggest.

-   **They play fewer hands overall:** Population folds a little more often than GTO. Both their calling and 3-betting frequencies are slightly lower.
-   **They react differently to a 4-bet:** This is where the key exploitable tendencies emerge.
    -   **They call less / over-fold:** Population calls a 4-bet only **3.3%** of the time, while GTO calls **~4.5%**. They are folding many suited broadways, connectors, and pocket pairs that GTO would continue with.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) more often with value:** Population is less likely to slow-play premium hands like Aces, Queens, and Ace-King suited. They tend to 5-bet jam these hands more frequently than GTO.

## 2. The Exploit: How Early Position Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Play a Similar Range to GTO

Interestingly, because the Button's tendencies balance each other out (they 3-bet slightly less, but then over-fold to our 4-bets), our overall continuing range remains very similar to a standard GTO range.

> Those two values balance each other out... we end up with a range that is quite similar to GTO.
>
> We are expecting to face a tighter three-betting range... But at the same time, we can expect them to fold more often whenever we do 4-bet.

### Postflop Adjustments vs. a Call

Because the population is jamming their premium hands more often preflop, their 4-bet calling range becomes weaker and more capped than a GTO calling range.

> Whenever your 4-bet does get called, you can expect a little bit of a weaker range than what would be theory; you don't expect too many slow-plays here from your opponent. And that means you can basically on average expect their range to be weaker overall.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds that we can open a wider range from early position. This is profitable because the Button is generally playing too passively and folding too often preflop.

> We can raise more hands. We can widen our opening range. And that is because again, we are expecting the button overall to play more passively, which means we can see the flop more often... but at the same time, we can also already expect more folds and just collect the pot way more often.
