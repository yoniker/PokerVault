2CardsConfidence showed that BB has a linear and scary range when he 3-bets (and btw showed that EP can open a range which is wider than BU which makes no sense as HJ/CO/BU/SB can 3-bet him easily so I will discard those findings including the CO findings).

Against BB 3-bet as EP, I want to play HYPER TIGHT, JJ are indifferent, QQ pure call, AQs is the worst hand which continues.
#  Population Exploit (Early Position vs. Big Blind)

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for Early Position (combining Under the Gun and Hijack) when facing a Big Blind 3-bet.

## 1. Analysis: Big Blind Tendencies (vs. Early Position)

The "average" player in the Big Blind plays extremely tight and passive when facing an open from early position.

-   **They call less often:** Population calls **~26%**, while GTO would call **28.5%**.
-   **They 3-bet MUCH less often:** This is the most significant deviation. Population 3-bets **less than 5%**, while GTO is around **7%**. This is a nearly **50% relative decrease** in 3-betting frequency.
-   **Their 3-betting range is more linear:** As seen before, they tend to 3-bet stronger hands and under-bluff with weaker suited hands.

## 2. The Exploit: How Early Position Should React

Given the Big Blind's incredibly strong and narrow 3-betting range, our exploitative adjustment must be drastic.

### The Core Adjustment: Fold a Lot More (An Extreme Fold)

> As the under the gun or hijack player, we want to be **folding a lot more often** whenever we do face a three-bet. So here this is actually much more extreme than the scenarios we have seen before... the range is just so much stronger than what would be the GTO range.
>
> The solver would as an exploit even fold **Ace-Jack suited** here. **King-Queen suited** most of the time... **Jacks are already folding almost half the time** against a three-bet.

### Why Do We Fold So Much?

Most players in the Big Blind are reluctant to 3-bet bluff against a tight early position open. They prefer to just call and see a flop.

> Most people think, "oh, they can just call a hand like... Queen-Eight suited or a King-Nine suited, why should I three-bet here if I can just see a flop?" and they will have so many less bluff hands here, which means that we just cannot continue with most of our range.

### Adjusting Your 4-Betting Strategy: Almost Never Bluff

Because the Big Blind's range is so strong and they are unlikely to fold to a 4-bet, bluffing is highly unprofitable.

> We almost don't want to bluff 4-bet here... No offsuit broadways are going to be 4-bet bluff here.
>
> Basically to keep it simple, don't go ahead and bluff 4-bet when you are in early position against the big blind three-bet. Just play straightforward. **4-bet your monster hands like Kings plus... you can also go ahead and 4-bet Ace-King, but don't do anything else.**

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario: An Extreme Exploit

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it identifies a massive opportunity for aggression due to the Big Blind's extreme passivity.

> The solver would be going pretty nuts. So it would be allowing us to **open more than 42% of hands**... increasing our frequency to an extreme amount would be the best exploit possible. We would just be profiting from so many more folds that the big blind is doing.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Early Position vs. Big Blind

> -   We can expect population in the Big Blind to call a little less and **three-bet a lot less** than GTO.
>
> -   When we face a three-bet, we have to again **fold a lot more** than in theory. Most suited broadways and medium to low pocket pairs that would be calls in GTO become exploitative folds.
>
> -   We **almost never 4-bet bluff** and mainly 4-bet Ace-King, Kings, and Aces.
>
> -   Because the Big Blind is so tight, you could exploit that by also **opening almost double the amount of hands** that would be GTO.
