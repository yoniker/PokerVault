My summary:
The exploit against population which opens tighter than GTO and calls a lot more vs 3-bet is to 3-bet way more linearly and a bit tighter (in terms of frequency) than GTO.

# Population Exploit (Big Blind vs. Cutoff)

This section continues the analysis from the Big Blind's perspective, this time facing a Cutoff open.

## 1. Analysis: Cutoff Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Cutoff deviates from GTO in several key ways, which informs our exploitative counter-strategy.

-   **They open less often:** Population opens a tighter range from the Cutoff than GTO would suggest (**~28%** vs. **30%+**).
-   **They call 3-bets too often:** They continue by calling with many hands that should be folded, such as weak offsuit broadways and medium-suited connectors like T8s and 98s.
-   **They 4-bet less often and with fewer bluffs:**
    > Population is not 4-betting nearly as often as GTO would suggest. Especially the bluff 4-bets which would be medium Ax-suited, Kx-suited hands... Those are not being 4-bet nearly as often as theory would say.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Big Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Play Tighter and More Linear

Because the Cutoff is opening a stronger range to begin with, and because they call 3-bets so frequently, our overall strategy should be tighter, and our 3-betting range should be more linear (value-heavy).

> For us in the big blind... we are actually allowed to **three-bet a lot more linear.** So we can now three-bet hands like Queen-Ten suited, King-Ten suited... Ace-Queen off will be a 100% three-bet though.
>
> If we face calls much more often than we should, then we would want to **tighten up our range and also make it more linear** so that we make sure we have a pretty strong range going to the flop.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet

The population's 4-betting range from the Cutoff is extremely strong and contains very few bluffs. This requires a massive adjustment from us.

> Whenever we do face a 4-bet, again **we just have to knit it up to an extreme extent.**
>
> King-Queen suited, basically, all of these Broadway suited hands would just have to **fold against a Cutoff 4-bet**, except for Ace-Queen suited.
>
> Even **Jacks would be 50% call, 50% fold** here, which just goes to show that this 4-betting range is really strong.

### Key Adjustments vs. a 4-Bet:

-   **Fold Almost Everything:** You must be prepared to fold nearly your entire 3-betting range, including most suited broadways.
-   **Never Slow-Play Aces:** Because the opponent's range is so value-heavy and lacks bluffs, there is no incentive to slow-play. You just want to fast-play it and get it in against their premium hands.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Big Blind vs. Cutoff

> -   We see **population open tighter than GTO** from the Cutoff. So we want to play tighter against an open as well, both in terms of calls as well as 3-bets.
>
> -   We again want to **three-bet more linear**, as we see population over-calling and under four-betting in the Cutoff.
>
> -   When we do face a 4-bet, we have to **massively knit it up** and fold all Broadway hands except for Ace-Queen suited and Ace-King.
>
> -   Even **Jacks are mixing calls and folds.**
