My summary:
They 3-bet less, and more linear, call more and fold less.
Therefore, I want to continue with way less hands (fold more),4-bet less,and call less.
Our 4-bet range is very strong and linear (TT+,AJo/AQo are the bluffs etc).
TODO who is correct, Nevir or 2cardsconfidence? Nevir said that vs BB 3-bet max exploit is 4-bet range I think. Which is correct?

Vs a 5-bet jam, we call off TT+, AQs+, and AKo+

# Population Exploit: Small Blind vs. Big Blind

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Small Blind when facing a 3-bet from the Big Blind.

## 1. Analysis: Big Blind Tendencies (vs. a Small Blind Open)

The "average" player in the Big Blind plays a more passive strategy against a Small Blind open than GTO would suggest.

-   **They 3-bet *much* less often:** Population 3-bets only **~11%**, while GTO is over **14%**. This is a significant 3% decrease in frequency. Their range is also more linear, meaning it's stronger on average.
-   **They call *much* more often:** Population calls **over 42%** of the time, compared to GTO's **35%**. They are calling with a wide variety of weak offsuit and suited hands that should be folded.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Small Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment: Continue with a Tighter Range

Because we are facing a 3-bet from a stronger, more linear range, our primary adjustment is to tighten up our continuing range.

> We want to be continuing less hands whenever we do face a three-bet... If the range we are facing as a three-bet is tighter and stronger overall, then of course we cannot continue the same hands.
>
> Hands like T7s, 97s... even 78s is never being called here. Even **pocket Threes and pocket Deuces cannot be called.**
>
> **King-Jack off** which feels like a very natural continue... is just too weak even in this position.

### Adjusting Your 4-Betting Strategy: Fewer Bluffs, More "Merge" Bets

Since the Big Blind's 3-betting range is stronger, we reduce our pure 4-bet bluffs. Instead, we use "merge" bluffs—hands that have good blockers and can also dominate parts of the Big Blind's wide 4-bet calling range.

> The only bluffs we really have are again those merge bluffs which are hands that benefit from having blockers... but also can dominate some of their calling range.
>
> We see that a lot of those suited broadways and even lower hands are being called against the 4-bet... so having **Ace-Jack off** serves well. We can play against Queen-Jack suited, King-Jack suited, even Jack-Ten... So having those hands as four-bets serves well.

### How to React When Facing a 5-Bet Jam

The population's 5-bet jamming range is reasonably well-constructed, including some bluffs like A5s and A4s. This allows us to make a standard call with our premium hands.

> Whenever we do face a jam we can see that we are calling **Tens-plus and even Ace-Queen suited** can be called here as well.

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario: Widen Your Opening Range

This is a key spot where adjusting your opening range is highly recommended. Because only one player is left to act, you can make a direct exploit without worrying about others.

> In this spot, small blind versus big blind, this is actually a spot that **I recommend adjusting your opening ranges.**
>
> We can widen it a little bit... **4% more** is what the solver would go for... We can just be looser a little bit and that is mostly because population tends to three-bet less often.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Small Blind vs. Big Blind

> -   We can expect the Big Blind to **3-bet less than GTO but call a lot more**, which makes us want to **4-bet less often** against the 3-bet.
>
> -   We want to include **fewer bluffs but more hands that can serve as value raises** (merge hands) because population is calling more hands than they should, so we want to dominate them.
>
> -   Against the jam, we can call **Tens-plus and Ace-Queen suited-plus.**
