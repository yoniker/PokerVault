# Population Tendencies & Exploits: A Summary

This document summarizes the key exploitable tendencies of the general player pool and the corresponding counter-strategies.

## 1. The Big Blind: Too Little, Too Linear

### Tendency:
> Population **three-bets too little from the Big Blind and too linear.** And that goes for every position: against the Button, against the Cutoff, and against Early Position.

### The Exploit:
> We want to **call less versus the Big Blind's three-bets.** We have to continue a tighter range. We usually don't want to 4-bet bluff and we overall just play tighter.

## 2. In Position: Under 4-Betting

### Tendency:
> Population tends to **under 4-bet in position**, especially when on the Button.

### The Exploit (from the Big Blind):
> We want to be **3-betting a linear range from the Big Blind**... a stronger range which also is under the protection of not being 4-bet off of our equity as much as it should happen in GTO.

## 3. The Small Blind: Over-Folding to 4-Bets

### Tendency:
> Population tends to **under-call versus 4-bets when they are in the Small Blind.**

### The Exploit:
> We can comfortably **increase our 4-bet bluffs** whenever we play against the Small Blind... We increase the amount of suited Ax, suited Kx hands that we want to 4-bet against them and also offsuit Broadway hands which have very good blockers.

## 4. vs. Early Position: Too Much Respect

### Tendency:
> Population generally **under 3-bets against Early Position.** This goes for when they are in position (Cutoff/Button) or out of position (Small Blind/Big Blind).

### The Exploit (from Early Position):
> We want to **call much tighter** because the three-betting range we are facing here is much stronger overall.

## 5. Overall 4-Betting: Too Tight, Too Few Bluffs

### Tendency:
> Just overall we see population **4-bet tighter and with less bluffs.**

### The Exploit:
> -   **Over-fold vs. 4-bets:** Whenever we do face a 4-bet, we want to fold more hands than we would otherwise... that usually goes for **suited broadways**.
> -   **Fast-play premium hands:** We want to slow-play less with our premium hands and instead fast-play them more often... We 5-bet, we jam, and we stack the strong hands that our opponent is 4-betting.

## 6. General Blind Play: Too Passive

### Tendency:
> Population plays **too passively in the blinds.** The Big Blind under 3-bets and the Small Blind under 4-bets.

### The Exploits:
> -   **As the Small Blind:** We can **open more hands** because we are not getting 3-bet as often.
>
> -   **As the Big Blind:** We can **3-bet more aggressively** because we don't face the 4-bet as often.
