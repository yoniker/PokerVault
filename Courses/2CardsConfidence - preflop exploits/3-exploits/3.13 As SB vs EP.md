My summary:
Population opens tighter than GTO (both LJ and HJ), and 4-bets less (calls more and folds less), so therefor I want to 3-bet about the same frequency and do it with a very linear range


# Population Exploit: Small Blind vs. Early Position

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Small Blind when facing an open from Early Position (Under the Gun/Hijack).

## 1. Analysis: Early Position Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in Early Position exhibits several key tendencies that inform our exploitative counter-strategy.

-   **They open a tighter range:** Population opens from early position even tighter than a GTO UTG range.
-   **They 4-bet MUCH less often:** This is the most significant deviation. Population 4-bets only **~2%**, while GTO would be around **3%**.
-   **Their 4-betting range has far fewer bluffs:** The population's 4-betting range is extremely value-heavy and straightforward.
    > We could see Ace-Queen off would be 4-bet bluffing basically 75% [in GTO]... at the same time suited King-x would be in here, suited Ax hands... those are never be seen as 4-bet bluffs by population. So whenever you do get four-bet by early position, just get the hell out of there.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Small Blind Should React

### The Core Adjustment (vs. an Open): 3-Bet a GTO Range

Interestingly, even though we are facing a tighter opening range, our 3-betting frequency remains similar to GTO. This is because the opponent's passivity (under 4-betting) compensates for their tighter opening range.

> Those two facts balance themselves out. So we arrive at basically the same three-betting range as in GTO.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: An Extreme Fold

This is the most critical takeaway. The population's 4-betting range from Early Position is so incredibly strong and devoid of bluffs that we must fold nearly everything, including hands that feel "too strong" to fold.

> We would have to **fold a lot of hands we would normally not have to fold.**
>
> -   Even **Ace-Queen suited**... is not good enough to continue.
> -   We actually even fold **Ace-King off** here.
> -   **Pocket Jacks** [are a] full frequency fold.

### Why is Folding AKo Not a Blunder?

It might feel weak, but against a range this strong, it is the correct, solver-approved play. Your intuition that your opponent "always has it" in this spot is often correct.

> In theory, Ace-King off would be an exploitative fold here, which just goes to show that population is really not going out of line here.
>
> How often have you been in a small blind... facing an early position 4-bet and just intuitively thought "this is never anything else but aces?" Here are now the facts. This is not always aces, but it's **basically never a bluff.** And for that reason, don't be afraid to make some big folds. It will actually profit you in the long run.

### What *Can* You Continue With?

-   **Jam for Value:** Shove your premium hands: **Pocket Kings and Pocket Aces.**
-   **Calls:** The only hands that can sometimes continue are **low suited connectors** (which play well vs. tight ranges) and **Ace-King suited**.
-   **The Edge Case:** Pocket Queens are on the edge. The solver folds them, but you might get away with calling in practice.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Small Blind vs. Early Position

> -   We do face a **tighter opening range** by population in early position, but we can still play basically a **GTO three-betting range** in the small blind.
>
> -   Early Position mainly **four-bets too little** against the three-bet. We also see **much less bluffs** than optimal.
>
> -   So, when we do get 4-bet, we have to play **extremely tight** and fold everything but **Queens-plus, Ace-King suited, and low suited connectors.**
