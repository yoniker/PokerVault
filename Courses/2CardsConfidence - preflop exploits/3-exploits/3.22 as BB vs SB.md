My summary:

Since their response to a 3-bet is so bad, I want to continue my entire range as a 3-bet, and not only that, but fold less(!) while doing that, eg, the solver would 3-bet 67% of his entire range, including hands as bad as K3o/Q5o/83s/62s, and that's because they overfold vs a 3-bet (by a few percents btw) and don't 4-bet enough. 
However, 2cardsconfidence says that villians will notice my approach and will adjust to it, so therefore I want to just increase the frequencies in which I 3-bet as BB vs SB, but not 3-bet range.

vs a 4-bet by sb, we actually Jam a lot more than GTO(!), and this is because they have some 4-bet bluffs like KQo, ATo,AJo

# Population Exploit: Big Blind vs. Small Blind

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Big Blind when facing an open from the Small Blind.

## 1. Analysis: Small Blind Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Small Blind opens at a similar frequency to GTO, but they make a critical and highly exploitable error when they face a 3-bet.

-   **Opening Frequency is similar to GTO:** Population opens at roughly the same rate as a GTO player would (**~44%**).
-   **They over-fold to 3-bets:** This is the most significant exploitable leak. Population folds to a 3-bet from the Big Blind more often than theory suggests.
    > Population simply tends to over-fold a lot against the three-bet.
-   **Their 4-betting range is more linear:** They tend to 4-bet more value hands and have fewer pure bluffs compared to GTO.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Big Blind Should React

### The Maximum Exploit: 3-Bet an Extremely Wide Range

Because the Small Blind is over-folding to 3-bets, the maximum theoretical exploit is to 3-bet an incredibly wide range of hands.

> This is pretty crazy because every hand we play basically if we want to three-bet... This is a **67.2% range** that the solver would be three-betting here as an exploit.

### A Practical, More Balanced Approach

In a real game, 3-betting nearly 70% of your hands is too extreme and will be easily noticed and countered. A more practical approach is to increase the frequency of your GTO 3-bets.

> **My advice:** Increase the amount of hands that are three-betting sometimes in GTO and still have a calling range...
>
> For example, instead of three-betting Queen-Six suited one-third of the time, you might go ahead and three-bet that hand every time... Your three-betting frequency goes up a lot, but it's not as crazy as in this approach so that your opponent can figure it out right away.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Jam a Wider, Polarized Range

Because the Small Blind's 4-betting range is more linear and contains fewer pure bluffs, the best counter is to expand our raising (5-bet jamming) range and shrink our calling range.

> Our opponent is 4-betting a more linear range and against that, **expanding your raising range performs better than expanding your calling range.**
>
> Basically **any pocket pair is good enough to jam here.** And even a lot of those suited Broadway hands: Ace-Jack suited, Ace-Ten suited, King-Jack, King-Queen, Queen-Jack suited, they would be just good enough to jam here.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Big Blind vs. Small Blind

> -   We'll face a **similar to GTO opening range** by the Small Blind.
>
> -   However, since population **over-folds and under four-bets**, the maximum exploit would allow us to go crazy and three-bet **67%** of hands.
>
> -   In practice, this is better replaced by a strategy that only **3-bets all GTO three-betting hands, but for a higher frequency.**
>
> -   Against the 4-bet, we play **very aggressively.** We call much less because we fold more often, but also **jam a lot more hands.**
