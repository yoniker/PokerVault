My summary:
Population is 3-betting less than GTO, CO call hands that GTO 3-bets or folds (like KTs,ATs,AQo). Notice that as usual, 2-cardsconfidence didn't allow flats from CO so that leads to an "exploitative" larger open range which is just wrong - if CO flats a lot then we should play tighter. 

Anyways vs a 3-bet we play a similar strategy as if we play vs GTO, just 4-bet a little bit less.
Why? vs 4-bets they jam a bit more than GTO


# Population Exploit: Early Position vs. Cutoff

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for Early Position when facing a 3-bet from the Cutoff.

## 1. Analysis: Cutoff Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player in the Cutoff exhibits several key tendencies when 3-betting against an Early Position open.

-   **They 3-bet less often:** Population 3-bets **~9%** of the time, while GTO would be over **10%**.
-   **They react differently to a 4-bet:** This is a crucial and somewhat surprising deviation.
    -   **They call less:** Population folds more of their medium-strength hands (like suited broadways and connectors) to a 4-bet than GTO would.
    -   **They jam (5-bet) *more* often:** For the first time, we see the population getting more aggressive with 5-bet shoves than theory suggests, including some bluffs like A5s.

## 2. The Exploit: How Early Position Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 4-Bet Less Often

Because the population is 5-betting more frequently (both for value and as bluffs), our primary adjustment is to tighten up our 4-betting range.

> We do want to 4-bet less often against population... The reason why we are 4-betting less in this exploitative approach is because we are getting five-bets shoved on more often.
>
> In theory, Ace-Jack suited, King-Queen suited would be four-bets here, but the exploitative approach against the real player pool would be to just call those.

### How to React When Facing a 5-Bet Jam

Since the population is jamming more often, our calling range vs. a shove is straightforward. We simply call with our premium value hands that we 4-bet in the first place.

> We just call with **Queens-plus and Ace-King.**

## 3. The "Unlocked RFI" Scenario

When we allow the solver to adjust our opening range, it finds that we can open a much wider range from early position.

> We could open much wider. So **more than 35% compared to 21%.**
>
> Why? First of all, of course, because we are facing three-bets much less often by the Cutoff... And that of course makes us win the pot more often, which is a reason to add more hands.

## 4. Summary: Key Takeaways for Early Position vs. Cutoff

> -   We can expect the average regular to **3-bet tighter** than in theory.
>
> -   We do continue a very similar range against the 3-bet to what is GTO, only **4-betting some bluffs less**, like King-Queen suited and Ace-Jack suited.
>
> -   In this scenario, the Cutoff's lower 3-betting frequency would also allow us to **open much wider** if we wanted to go for a full exploit.
