My summary:
They open a similar range to GTO, but they have a poor response to a 3-bet, therefore I can 3-bet a wider range than GTO.
Their response to a 3-bet is fold a little bit more, 4-bet a bit less.
 
Vs a 4-bet: Since their range is super strong, I can continue only with nutted hands:
Call QQ/AKs pure, call AQs sometimes,and otherwise 5-bet KK+ and AKo



# Population Exploit: Hijack vs. UTG

This section analyzes the exploitative strategy for the Hijack when facing an open from an Under the Gun (UTG) player.

## 1. Analysis: UTG Tendencies (Population vs. GTO)

The "average" player at UTG exhibits several key tendencies when facing a 3-bet from the Hijack.

-   **They over-fold to 3-bets:** Population folds to a 3-bet from the Hijack more often than theory suggests.
-   **They 4-bet less often and with fewer bluffs:** Population's 4-betting range is much tighter than GTO, with a 4-bet frequency of only **~3%** compared to GTO's **3.5%**. Their range is heavily weighted towards value and lacks the appropriate bluffing hands.

## 2. The Exploit: How the Hijack Should React

### The Core Adjustment: 3-Bet More Often and More Linearly

Because the UTG player is both over-folding to 3-bets and under 4-betting, our primary exploit is to become more aggressive by 3-betting a wider and more linear range.

> We can three-bet more hands. So close to **11%** is what would be the exploitative approach here. Just filling up those Queen-Ten suited, Jack-Ten suited combos. King-Queen off would be in there almost always.
>
> The reason we can do that is... because population 4-bets less often.

### How to React When Facing a 4-Bet: Over-Fold

Since the UTG 4-betting range is so strong and value-heavy, our primary adjustment is to fold a significant portion of our 3-betting range. This is a recurring and critical theme against tight 4-bettors.

> We are again facing a tighter range compared to the theoretical approach. And that means of course that we want to play tighter against that 4-betting range... We cannot continue with those suited broadway hands here. Even **Ace-Queen suited** would be in there only a little bit more than half of the time and **pocket Jacks also would be close to a pure fold.**

### What *Can* You Continue With?

-   **Calls:** The hands that perform best as calls against this tight 4-betting range are **low suited connectors**, which have good equity and playability.
-   **5-Bet Jams:** We want to fast-play our premium value hands. There is no incentive to slow-play against a range with so few bluffs.
    > You want to be fast-playing your premium hands again. Pocket Kings would be a fast play... In this case, Aces, just go ahead and jam them in.

## 3. Summary: Key Takeaways for Hijack vs. UTG

> -   As the Hijack, we can **three-bet more often** against an Under the Gun open, as we'll see more folds and less 4-bets than optimal.
>
> -   This means their 4-betting range is stronger, and against it, our exploit will be to **over-fold.** Almost all suited broadways and even **pocket Jacks are mostly a fold.**
>
> -   At the same time, this makes us **never want to slow-play Aces**, which would always be the case in GTO.
