# Methodology: How Exploit Ranges Are Created

## The Core Question

> So, let's pick up the question from the intro. Where do these exploit ranges come from? How did I work out the exploitative preflop strategies against the player pool?

## Step 1: Data Collection and Filtering

The process begins by analyzing a large database of hands to understand how the "average" player behaves.

> I went into my database in **Hand2Note**, which is a database software that allows you to analyze mass data of player pools.
>
> I filtered my **1 million hand sample** to only include regular players with a VPIP of 20 to 30 who have played at least 100 hands with me on PokerStars. The combined hands that this selected group of players has played add up to **3.4 million.**

## Step 2: From Showdown Data to a Working Range

The raw data from Hand2Note shows which hands were seen at showdown, but this isn't a complete picture of an opponent's range. It requires interpretation.

> Hand2Note then presents me the preflop range that all players in the selected player group... have collectively shown down... This is the **population tendency** in this player pool.
>
> However, this is not a range we can simply copy onto a solver. I'm using **HRC (Holdem Resources Calculator)** for preflop simulations and the software needs me to input the calling and the raising range... which is why we need to convert this Hand2Note range into a range we can work with.

### The Challenge of Interpretation

-   **Frequencies are Reliable:** The overall frequency of an action (e.g., the Big Blind 3-bets 12% of the time) is a very solid and reliable number over millions of hands.
-   **Showdowns are an Estimation:** The specific hands shown down are just a guideline. We have to use our best judgment to build a complete range from this partial data.
    > Sample sizes can be very small for specific hands... Also, how many possible combos a hand has and the likelihood that they get to showdown... vary for different kinds of hands.

> So, when in doubt, besides the showdown data, I had to add in my own experience of playing in this player pool and also what would be the GTO approach to come up with a good distribution of hands.

## Step 3: Simulating the Exploits

Once the population ranges are built, they are plugged into the solver (HRC) to find the optimal counter-strategy.

### The Simulation Process:
1.  **Start with GTO:** I ran one simulation completely based on GTO to get every player's GTO ranges.
2.  **Isolate the Spot:** For a Button vs. Big Blind spot, I pruned all other players' child nodes so the solver only calculates the relevant interactions.
3.  **Insert Population Data (Node-Locking):**
    *   For the **Big Blind**, I inserted the ranges we worked out from the player pool data (e.g., their specific calling and 3-betting ranges). These ranges are **node-locked** because they are a given; this is how the population plays.
4.  **Unlock to Find the Exploit:**
    *   For the **Button**, the opening range is left as GTO, but the reactions to the Big Blind's actions (e.g., facing a 3-bet or a 5-bet jam) are left **unlocked**.
5.  **Run the Simulation:** The solver then calculates the best possible strategy (the maximum exploit) for the unlocked nodes, given the locked population tendencies.

## Summary of the Method

> Summed up, simulating an exploit strategy for the button against the big blind:
>
> We have a simulation where we have every player play GTO **except** for the button and the big blind.
>
> -   **For the Big Blind:** We have inserted the calling and raising ranges we worked out from the player pool data... Those ranges are **node-locked**.
> -   **For the Button:** The opening range is a GTO range, but every other node against the big blind... are **unlocked**.
>
> So that the ranges we receive here are the **maximum exploit strategies** that we can play against population. Now the only thing left to do is run the simulation and look at the results.
