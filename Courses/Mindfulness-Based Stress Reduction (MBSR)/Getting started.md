# MBSR Week 1: My Goals & Getting Started

*Palouse Mindfulness - Beginning My Journey*

-----

## 📋 My Goals & Commitment Worksheet

### 🎯 By the end of the course, I am hoping that:

- I will be able to maintain better focus at the poker table, noticing when my mind wanders and gently bringing attention back to the present game
- I will develop a different relationship with pre-game anxiety - acknowledging the stress without being controlled by it, allowing me to play more sessions
- I will learn to observe my thoughts and emotions during play without getting caught up in them, making decisions from a place of awareness rather than reactivity
- I will accept the natural ups and downs of poker with more equanimity, seeing both wins and losses as part of the experience

### 💪 Some of my strengths are:

- Strong willingness to learn and grow, which will help me stay committed to the daily practice even when it feels challenging
- Intellectually curious and capable of understanding concepts deeply, which will help me grasp both the practice and theory of mindfulness
- Genuine humility and lack of ego, allowing me to acknowledge weaknesses without judgment - this self-honesty is crucial for mindfulness
- Ability to observe myself objectively, which is essentially what mindfulness is about

### ⏰ When will I practice:

**5:00pm every day**, or if I can’t make 5pm, then just before going to the casino (usually around 6pm). On casino days, this gives me time to center myself before playing.

### 🏠 Where I am planning to practice:

**In my room**, where I can close the door and have privacy without interruptions.

### 📚 The times and day(s) of the week I will do the videos and readings:

**Every Sunday** - I will dedicate time to complete that week’s 2 hours of videos and readings. This will prepare me for the upcoming week of practice.
