My summary:
Exploitative poker is all about:
1. Knowing what mistakes are possible
2. Recognizing when opponents are doing those
3. Know how to deviate


This is the transcript only:

Hey everyone, I want to start out this course by talking about why exploit. This wasn't an easy decision to start out talking about and I want to throw out a caveat that structuring this course was kind of difficult with exploitation. There are a lot of interconnected parts. It's not a subject you can study linearly because as I'm talking about why exploit, you guys don't necessarily think of exploit in the same way I do.

Speaker

00:28 - 00:54

and you can't really understand exploitation without understanding what GTO is and you guys don't necessarily think of GTO in the same way I do and all these things are gonna come so please bear with me if some of the stuff I'm saying doesn't make sense right away we are gonna cover everything. I want to start out with why exploit? It's really important for you guys to understand why and to be convinced that this is a good way to play

S

Speaker

00:55 - 01:21

because very different from other forms of poker when you're playing exploitative poker you're going out on a limb and you're taking big risks the very nature of exploitative poker is that you gain more win rate by risking more win rate if we're doing a fight metaphor you're like throwing a big punch but you're leaving yourself vulnerable and if the other guy knows what's going on you're in trouble

S

Speaker

01:21 - 01:42

So you have to be very very accurate with what you're doing and you have to be convinced it works. Very often when I work with students they learn this stuff but it takes them a long time to feel the confidence to actually execute it. So very often they have this aha moment after a few months.

S

Speaker

01:42 - 02:07

and then their win rate in their game start changing. But until then they're studying all this stuff but they can't really follow through in the moment just because it's so scary. It's very important that you're internally convinced about what you're doing because exploiting can lead you to make very crazy plays and very risky plays. It's very easy for someone to say: "hmm you know I don't really want to do this"

S

Speaker

02:07 - 02:36

"Why not just follow the GTO chart and use my random number generator, do some kind of balance strategy, only bluff the bottom of my range, only call the correct bluff catcher?" Like, why shouldn't I just do that? And you can of course just do that. But I'm gonna show you guys over and over again during this course how that would be leaving money on the table. Not something you want to do when you're playing poker, you don't want to leave money at the table. We want all the money.

S

Speaker

02:36 - 02:52

Okay, so with that, I'm going to start out by giving you guys a metaphor, a chess metaphor, actually. The chess opening is like a scripted series of moves in the beginning of the game. And the reason it's scripted is because chess has been so researched that

S

Speaker

02:52 - 03:15

When one player starts in a certain way, everyone knows what the first correct 20 moves are going to be. And after those moves, you start having options and you start playing chess. As you're playing, especially when you're playing at a non-expert level, very often your opponent will not know the correct scripted moves in an opening. So you'll start out with a script that you've been taught.

S

Speaker

03:16 - 03:43

and somewhere, you know, maybe the second move, maybe the eighth move, your opponent will make a different move than the one in the script. And here different is going to be generally an inferior move. So he's going to make some kind of mistake or blunder, but not necessarily an obvious one. It's not like he's hanging a piece, he's moving a piece to a place you can just take it. Very often it's something more subtle. Now, the way I view exploitative poker...

S

Speaker

03:43 - 04:04

is that rather than focusing on the script of the opening water, the correct 20 moves, our focus is on what do I do whenever my opponent blunders. So in a way when you're studying exploitative poker, you do of course learn the correct 20 moves, but you learn them in a much deeper way

S

Speaker

04:04 - 04:33

than you would if you were just learning the opening because every move you understand on a deep level what's the reason to make the move but you also understand like every little mistake your opponent makes what you do against it so you understand on a really really deep level kind of the equilibrium of what's going on like you have to make this exact move because otherwise you know a b c d all these pieces are going to fall into a place into place and you're going to lose so in my eyes this is exploitative poker it's studying

S

Speaker

04:33 - 04:55

You know, you do study the correct way to play, but you're looking around. You're looking at the context of what's going on rather than focusing on, you know, here I have to block this combo or here I need to do this and this and that. It's more like, if I don't do this, how can my opponent mess me up?

S

Speaker

04:55 - 05:06

Like why is this important? How important is it? Maybe it's not really important. So we're going to jump from that to how solvers work and for this I am going to pull up a solver

S

Speaker

05:06 - 05:34

I know not everyone who's purchased the course necessarily has worked with solvers, so I'll try to make this both short and simple. We'll take in this instance cutoff versus UTG3 bet fault on a certain board. And what we're going to do is we're going to run a computer with these parameters. So there are ranges, there's a board, and there are possible bet sizes. And it's going to iterate between strategies

S

Speaker

05:34 - 05:50

until it finds the optimal strategy. We're going to talk about what that is, but I want to show you guys the iterations. So we start out by building a tree. And at this point, you guys can see the first player has two options. He can bet or check.

S

Speaker

05:51 - 06:16

and every hand is doing each option an equal amount of the time. This is how the tree gets built. Now if I bet, my opponent can fold, call, or he has two raise sizes. And you guys can see here on the screen 25, 25, 25, 25. Each option is being used equally. I could go all in, my opponent would call half the time and fold half the time.

S

Speaker

06:17 - 06:38

So this is how the solver starts the tree. And what happens as it's iterating is each player is going to try to exploit the other player's strategy. So if I click, if I were to click like, go stop. So we did a really fast iteration. You can see the first player is now betting more.

S

Speaker

06:39 - 06:58

And suddenly the numbers are not all equal. But there are of course big big issues with the strategies. For example if I bet third pot and the other guy shoves, now in position is calling 39% of his range. I doubt it's going to remain that wide. Maybe, who knows.

S

Speaker

06:59 - 07:16

But the idea is each player is calculating like the best possible strategy against the other player. You do this over and over and over and over again. And each time the strategies get more difficult to exploit until at some point we reach this

S

Speaker

07:16 - 07:37

thing called a Nash equilibrium where neither player can change anything about his strategy in order to exploit the other one more. So solvers start out with everything random, they go exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit. Once they're done with this, you know, each time they find less and less stuff to do.

S

Speaker

07:37 - 08:01

Then they're like, okay, this is the way to play. And that's how most people play. But we're going to be focused on the exploit-exploit part of the solver, which is a big, big part of what's going on here. You can look at the final solution and be like, okay, I want to just do this, but you're missing out on the reasons that everything is there and you're missing out on...

S

Speaker

08:01 - 08:12

what if my opponent is not playing like this what should I do about it the answer is in the same computer program but you're not necessarily trained to look for it or look at it

S

Speaker

08:12 - 08:31

You guys can see as the solver is running, these kind of sims run really, really fast. It becomes exploitable for less and less as the strategies get more fine-tuned. We can probably stop it at this point. And here we're going to look at a triple barreling scenario where it goes, you know,

S

Speaker

08:31 - 08:42

Bet 1/3 on A-Skin 3, 2-tone. Don't take this as a correct bet size, it's just for the example. Have a 6-turn, we're gonna bet, we decide

S

Speaker

08:42 - 09:03

that we want to go all in and here you guys can see our opponent's calling range. Now what I'm going to do here is use a tool called node locking. I'm going to alter one of the player's strategies and we're going to see how that affects EVs. So before we start of course we want to write some numbers down. So

S

Speaker

09:04 - 09:26

at this kind of equilibrium of where the program thinks everything is equal. The EV for in position is $562.5. We're going to now compare exploitative and not exploitative strategies. So right now in position is playing river kind of perfect frequency. So he's value betting just the right amount.

S

Speaker

09:26 - 09:51

He's making this crazy move shoving ace-9, which is a move we're going to talk about down the line in the course. Ace-9 is really crazy because you shove ace-9 and your opponent calls you with ace-4 and ace-5, but he folds some ace-10 and ace-jack. So in the end, you have 35% equity, but you've done this kind of weird thing to his range where you're actually having happy shoving. It's really crazy.

S

Speaker

09:51 - 10:14

and it is a useful play against some players. Here in positions range is like perfectly balanced. This makes your opponent have like zero EV-ish bluff catching decisions with a bunch of hands. But let's say we're playing against someone and we know that this player doesn't like bluff catching very much. He doesn't believe you're gonna triple barrel A-S-K-3-6-8.

S

Speaker

10:14 - 10:43

And the reason he doesn't believe this is he doesn't think you'd necessarily barrel turn with a gutshot. He thinks you would give up your flush draws on the river. He definitely doesn't think you'd ever barrel a hand like a low pocket pair or something like that. So he's not really into bluff catching. And there are lots of players like this. So he's not going to call you with ace4 and ace5. He's not going to call you with ace9, ace10, and ace jack.

S

Speaker

10:43 - 11:04

and he is probably gonna fold his ace queen say one third of the time still gonna convince himself to call because it's top of range and stuff but fold a little bit definitely fold king queen we'll even add ace queen back in so this is how i think the standard kind of nitty opponent

S

Speaker

11:04 - 11:33

would play in a lot of games in a lot of poker games you'll see a lot of player types and we're gonna get to talking about player types down down the line in the course who are not fond of bluff catching and these are very easy to recognize because you're playing with them for a while and you never see them make a crazy hero call and in poker you're supposed to make crazy hero calls so if someone ever does probably not fond of bluff catching now we talked about these

S

Speaker

11:34 - 11:53

You guys can see that after I log in positions EV on the river, we've gained $2 for our total range. Really cool. Now why only $2? If you look at something like Queen 10 suited, Queen 10 suited EV is $490. So where did all the dollars disappear?

S

Speaker

11:53 - 12:19

And the answer is: all our value bets win less money. Sure, our bluffs win more money, value bets less, and in the end, because things are balanced, just because our opponent doesn't like bluff catching, we make a bit more money because some of those bluff catches were slightly plus EV. Were he to fold ace queen, we'd make even more more money. So you do make money when your opponent deviates.

S

Speaker

12:19 - 12:47

I want to compare this to let's say for example that you know I've been playing with this guy for a while I have a strong suspicion he doesn't know how to bluff catch so I'm gonna go ahead and assume he doesn't and then on the river anything I get to the river with it can't beat the king I'm just gonna fire away so here we're gonna click ctrl b and we're gonna enter

S

Speaker

12:48 - 13:03

the node that we're in the river node i i clicked uh just showing for the guys who do use a solver you right click on this r0cd61 right click copy then you want to do solve partial

S

Speaker

13:03 - 13:29

this any questions of course will i can explain everything this is what you get you do send and now what the solver has done is it's redone the process of you know everyone does the best exploitative thing but the out of position player is locked i haven't let him respond so this process is going to be instant it's just one player adjusting his strategy in position player he is now firing with

S

Speaker

13:30 - 13:35

Everything that doesn't beat Slike ACE9 is even firing.

S

Speaker

13:36 - 14:03

You know, just firing away with everything that doesn't beat Ace-10 pretty much. Now what happened to his EV now is $647.56. You guys can see how dramatic a difference this is. And this is in a nutshell what exploitative poker is. You could say, I'll just play GTO. I'll show down 10s because it sometimes wins. And you could play like that.

S

Speaker

14:03 - 14:17

It's a fine way to play. If you do it really, really well, you're going to do great. But when you're doing that, you're in a race against everyone else who's also doing that. And it's just not the best way to play because...

S

Speaker

14:17 - 14:46

face the facts, the people you're playing with in poker, you know a lot of them are playing whatever stake you're playing, is it 50 NL, is it 200 NL, is it 1000 NL, whichever stake someone is playing, he's not playing higher generally for the most part because he's not good enough. He's not good enough because he's making mistakes. And it's up to us to find the mistakes, make him pay for them, and then move up the stakes at his expense. In this instance, if he checks,

S

Speaker

14:47 - 15:13

And position gets to value bet ace-queen+ and not value betting ace-queen is a 7-big blind mistake. We could go with more nuanced examples. This was a very, very extreme one. What we could do for a different kind of example is maybe donk betting. If we go same board, king of diamonds river. King of diamonds river, the out of position player, is supposed to donk bet. He's supposed to donk bet shop with king-queen.

S

Speaker

15:13 - 15:37

You're supposed to do it with Ace Queen a little bit and with King Jack a bit and check the rest. Not everyone does this. There are a bunch of players who you play with. They're gonna get to this river, they're not really gonna think about donk betting. They're gonna auto-check. Phil Hellmuth style, right? Check in the dark. They're not doing the donk betting thing. Of course, they should, but they're not. Now, let's say someone's not doing the donk betting thing.

S

Speaker

15:37 - 16:06

And again here I want to show you guys the EV for in position is 364.2. Now we're gonna change this and we're gonna node lock. And we're just gonna node lock to no donk betting. So basically forcing the player to not donk bet. And again we're gonna right click, copy node ID, control V, I already have the solve partial.

S

Speaker

16:06 - 16:19

here and just replace the node with a new node and rerun. I messed up the way I did this, so give me one second. I will change it to a king of clubs in position E366.

S

Speaker

16:21 - 16:48

9. So, no donk betting. Now Eevee for in position is 369.4. So, again, you know, we've gained $3 or $2.5 or whatever by the opponent not donk betting. But our strategy didn't change because we're still playing GTO, we're still playing perfect, and we're still shoving our ace queens. But, you know, shoving ace queen isn't very good anymore.

S

Speaker

16:48 - 17:17

If you look at the EV for shoving Ace-Queen, it's not really making you money. And the Ace-Jack, which sometimes gets shoved, is losing you 11 big blinds. And actually, with the current frequencies, our bluffs are now losing us money some of the time. Let's again do the copy node ID. We'll do the exploit thing. Now the exploit thing is going to say, if you check and you don't donk bet,

S

Speaker

17:17 - 17:46

I'm not really that interested in bluffing so much or betting ace queen. I'm just going to freeze up. I'm going to, you know, maybe a bit of ace queen, but mostly just go boats and bluff a lot less. And if we look at in position EV now, position EV goes up to 374.4. So not nearly as dramatic of a difference as we had before, because it's not as dramatic of a mistake. But

S

Speaker

17:46 - 18:07

These kind of mistakes can be more or less dramatic. You have to kind of take the risk reward and how confident you are about what's going on. But this is another example of, you know, if your opponent knows how to play perfectly, you know how to play perfectly. Good luck to both of you playing nosebleeds. But most cases...

S

Speaker

18:08 - 18:37

You know that there are guys who don't donk bet against those guys. You have to be a bit more careful with what you're doing on the river. And in this example, ace-queen can still value bet. It's not a blunder to do that. But some examples, it will actually be a fairly big blunder to value bet ace-queen on the river. So we have two examples of how exploiting correctly can win from like tons and tons of money compared to playing perfectly.

S

Speaker

18:37 - 18:54

to relatively small amounts of money, but still significant compared to playing perfectly. We're going to kind of build an exploitative game plan and exploitative tools to cover a lot of these different situations, whether it's recognizing and knowing what to do

S

Speaker

18:54 - 19:23

from preflop down to postflop against the first guy who's overfolding or whether it's, you know, even thinking like, does this guy donk bet and how does that affect my river strategy? And realizing that that's a real thing and something that you should be aware of. Not just like I need to donk bet, but also what if I don't donk bet? What happens to the strategies? So I want to talk a bit about GTO. GTO...

S

Speaker

19:23 - 19:34

also known as Game Theory Optimal. It's something that's been with us a long time, way before Solvers. And there's a bit of a history lesson

S

Speaker

19:34 - 19:55

The way GTO used to be perceived was similar to balance, to the concept of balance. And the idea was nobody really knew what they were doing and people would get into these leveling wars. You know, should I bluff or shouldn't I bluff? Is he going to call or isn't he going to call? Is he bluffing or isn't he bluffing?

S

Speaker

19:55 - 20:10

and it would get into a big guessing game and the best players back in the day were just the guys who were really really good at playing this guessing game but then people came up with this idea of GTO you know if I make a pot-sized riverbed

S

Speaker

20:11 - 20:35

and for every two value bets I have, I have one bluff. What are you gonna do about it? Now just to show you guys the math really fast, if I bet, if the pot is, no, $1,000 and I bet $1,000 with two value bets and one bluff, then if you call a bluff catcher, what's your EB? Two out of three times,

S

Speaker

20:35 - 20:56

You lose 1000 and one out of three times you win the pot plus my bet. So you win 2000 and the sum of these is zero. So by getting to this kind of balanced point with my range, I'm forcing you into a situation where the EV of all your bluff catchers is zero. And you know, zero means you might as well fold.

S

Speaker

20:56 - 21:12

And there is no leveling going on. There's nothing you can do about it. Like if I'm balanced, I'm invincible. This is the history of GTO. This was always something really, really tempting. I had a friend back when I was coming up in poker who loved this concept so much.

S

Speaker

21:12 - 21:34

He spent maybe a year with Excel charts and everything. He was like, I'm going to make my game perfect GTO. End of the story was, you know, he started out a 2BB winner, 2BB per 100 winner at NL200. And he finished a 2BB per 100 winner at NL200. And he quit poker. He wasn't making progress. He loved the work he was doing.

S

Speaker

21:35 - 21:45

all the calculations, it made him feel really good, but it didn't add to his win rate. There are multiple reasons for that. And the first one is that the model I just showed you guys, the map,

S

Speaker

21:46 - 22:08

doesn't work in the real world. The first very very basic reason that this doesn't work has to do with blockers. This completely ignores blockers and you know if I'm structuring my range to have one bluff for every two value bets and you have any kind of positive blocker interaction with the board you're gonna have a plus EV call. I would definitely be over bluffing.

S

Speaker

22:09 - 22:34

Or at least I'd let you have very easy bluff catching decisions if I was structuring my range this way. But this is how people used to think about GTO, kind of connected to minimum defense frequency, like how much does someone need to defend, how much do you need to bluff. A lot of this math is in the DNA of poker and the DNA of poker concept, so it's important to understand that when people are saying GTO, they're thinking about a game plan

S

Speaker

22:34 - 22:53

that's perfect in a way where there's nothing your opponent can do to exploit you so in a way they're worried about people exploiting and they're saying well you can't exploit me and this play style when it's implemented in a more advanced or modern way it

S

Speaker

22:53 - 23:17

It does lead to you winning money. If we say that the history of GTO was just, you know, minimum defense frequency, and we will touch on all these subjects more deeply down the line in the course, modern GTO is based on studying with solvers and with computers and having these kind of exploit, counter-exploit, endgame strategies that

S

Speaker

23:17 - 23:31

are in a way unbeatable and have all this crazy stuff going on in them. If you guys remember, like if I put the eight of spades on the river, we have the ace-nine shoving. This is part of a GTO solution.

S

Speaker

23:32 - 23:53

Like there's crazy, crazy, crazy stuff going on in GTO solutions. And when you shove your opponent, you know, calls ace-4 always and folds ace-5 sometimes. So there's all this crazy stuff going on. The frequencies are definitely not the way you would have imagined if you were an old school player with old school math.

S

Speaker

23:53 - 24:21

but they do have their own sense. But GTO also includes a ton of really advanced concepts like the ace-9 shove and there are lots of other tricky things in there. And it also includes understanding how thin and how big you can value bet in every spot. Water like the correct blockers to bluff catch with and the incorrect blockers to bluff catch with. Here for example you can see you know king-queen is a minus EV bluff catch.

S

Speaker

24:21 - 24:45

because the range is being structured in a way where you're only indifferent if you have the ace blocker right we talked about removal effect so it doesn't work like this it's more if you call a bluff catcher with a certain blocker so it's not going to be two to one we're going to have extra value bets to make up for the fact that our opponent often has has this blocker and then

S

Speaker

24:46 - 25:07

presumably somebody who doesn't understand gto and there's a ton to understand it it's really interesting stuff is gonna make calls with the wrong blockers he's gonna miss some of these in between really sexy shops that are making money maybe he's gonna miss the value betting threshold and maybe you know some spots

S

Speaker

25:08 - 25:34

where here you guys can see bluffing a hand like Jack-10 wins you money or Queen-10 of hearts wins you four big blinds and this is not a locked Sim this is just the way the spot works and some people might not realize that so GTO perfect poker right like you realize everything you have all the perfect frequencies to make your opponent not able to exploit you but you're also very very accurate

S

Speaker

25:34 - 25:55

Lots of spots in poker where a bluff makes money. We didn't used to know this before computers. If you go back in time, I don't know what was it, 2012 or so, people thought that the out of position player would defend in a way where the in position players' bluffs would not make any money.

S

Speaker

25:55 - 26:19

But computers have shown that this is sometimes true and sometimes false, and you need to be able to tell the difference. I think it's very, very important to understand GTO when we're talking about exploitation, because when you look at modern poker players, a lot of the professionals or the wannabe professionals or the recreationals, a lot of them

S

Speaker

26:20 - 26:33

think about GTO, they think about balance, they think about ranges and when we're in the mindset of exploiting we want to know what the other guys are thinking because nobody in the world

S

Speaker

26:33 - 26:56

knows how to play GTO very well. The best players know how to do it better than others, but everyone is very, very far away and everyone misses tons of stuff. That's where exploiting comes in. When you're exploiting, you're not really looking to hit the mark in terms of, you know, getting everything perfect. You're more looking to see where and how your opponent misses the mark.

S

Speaker

26:56 - 27:17

So when shouldn't you GTO? The common answer to this, and I think this is almost universally accepted by players, is that whenever you're playing against a recreational, you don't play GTO. Like, it's a waste of time. The recreational player has a weak enough game where you can understand

S

Speaker

27:17 - 27:28

How he's going to react to certain things. Is he going to be bluffing too much or folding too much? What bet size is he going to be willing to call enough when you're value betting?

S

Speaker

27:28 - 27:55

All these things, we think that we know how to do these well, so we don't go for GTO, we go for pure exploitative poker for the most part versus recreational players. I think this is generally accepted and anything else would be leaving money on the table, like anything else is a waste of time. If we take it to the extreme, say you're playing against someone, it's their first time playing poker, they have absolutely no clue what they're doing.

S

Speaker

27:55 - 28:17

And a very common thing that people do the first time they play poker is that they are completely clueless about pot odds and they keep making min bets because they don't know what they're doing. So the pot might be $100, they'll just bet $2. Now against this type of player, there are very big strategy adjustments that you can make to greatly increase your EV.

S

Speaker

28:18 - 28:38

There are lots of them, but like the very basic one, you play all of your hands that are bluff catchers and very passive lines because there's going to be no pressure on them. You can actually completely control the pot size with each of your hands and make it the exact size that's appropriate for your hand.

S

Speaker

28:38 - 28:54

So if you know the pot size that's appropriate for your hand, just do that with every hand. Recreational player at the end of the day, what we mean when we say, you know, this guy's bad enough, I don't need to play GTO against him. What we mean is that this is a player

S

Speaker

28:54 - 29:09

who is making mistakes that I can see and predict, I know how to do something about them, and I understand poker better than he does in a way that he's not gonna be as fast as me

S

Speaker

29:09 - 29:35

When I'm exploiting him, he's not going to notice, he's not going to know what to do about it. So I'm going to get the upper hand compared to Ethereum and win more than my fair share of the money. Now, all you need to do this against someone is to know more than they do or to recognize their mistakes and to know how to exploit them in a way that they don't notice, which is also something we're going to talk about. If we talk about the poker mountain,

S

Speaker

29:35 - 29:47

You know, someone who's playing for tens of thousands of dollars, when he goes and plays NL200, everyone is a recreational to him.

S

Speaker

29:48 - 30:10

all the players are making these obvious mistakes he knows how to exploit them he sees mistakes left and right and remember guys someone who's playing for 500 dollars there's generally a reason it's 500 and not 1 million and the reason is you know he might be in the 98th percentile of best poker players in the world but he's not in the top top

S

Speaker

30:10 - 30:34

And that means he's making mistakes left and right. Everyone's making mistakes left and right. So as you climb the poker mountain, when you have an exploitative standpoint, an exploitative approach to the game, you're treating more and more players and more and more situations as recreationals. There is a term in poker that's looked down on by some people called bum hunting.

S

Speaker

30:34 - 30:55

which is like, you know, you hunt the weaker players, but if you become a strong exploitative player, everyone around you is a weaker player. Like you can bum hunt regulars. And I was throughout my career constantly bum hunting regulars. Like I wouldn't need a recreational at the table because if I know

S

Speaker

30:55 - 31:23

If we go back to the previous example that someone is, you know, over-folding in a bunch of spots, I knew how to structure my game in a way where money would flow very quickly from him to me so I wouldn't need anyone else at the table other than that guy in order to make money. This is only because I was willing to deviate very, very strongly and very quickly from GTO. This brings me to the doctor action story. Friend of a friend, he staked me as I was coming up in poker and

S

Speaker

31:24 - 31:53

Back then I was starting out at mid stakes and he was already playing nosebleeds. And I was asking him some theory questions and hand history questions now and then. He was very, very focused on GTO and balance. I think most of the nosebleed guys were back then. And I remember I'd sometimes ask him questions and he'd always tell me, well, you know, this combo and this combo. And if you're doing that, you bluff too much and

S

Speaker

31:53 - 32:11

yo combo counting blah blah blah and i kept trying to tell him you know but i think this guy is folding too much here or i think this is gonna get called i kept trying to shift the conversation in that direction it didn't really work i didn't feel like he understood my questions

S

Speaker

32:12 - 32:42

And at some point I realized that, you know, maybe the reason he doesn't understand what I want from him is that it's actually fairly simple. You know, you don't need to ask a coach if my opponent is overfolding in this spot, should I bluff or not? The answer is staring you in the face. Obviously you should bluff. The trouble is knowing how to recognize whether or not your opponent is overfolding and at

S

Speaker

32:43 - 33:02

Of course, at high stakes, that gets tougher and tougher as people get better and better. But yeah, I have a feeling he wasn't answering the question because he was, you know, it's too simple. It's too obvious. And the question of, you know, how can you tell if someone's overflowing? And that wasn't the one I was asking back then.

S

Speaker

33:02 - 33:30

Okay, so this brings us towards the end of this video. We're going to talk about the three bases of exploitative poker, the three things that you need to know how to do. As you're going to see throughout this course, playing exploitative poker is more fun than GTO poker. It's not necessarily easier in terms of you do need to understand more, but it's a different type of understanding and different type of work and thought process.

S

Speaker

33:30 - 34:00

So the three bases that you need in order to play good exploitative poker. Number one, you need to know what kind of mistakes are possible to make in poker. The more mistakes you know, the stronger your exploitative game is going to be. And here we covered the super obvious overfolding. Then we covered the much less obvious not donk betting. And there are a ton of other things

S

Speaker

34:01 - 34:22

going on. We even touched a little bit, you know, the ACE9 shove. People can make or not make that. There are adjustments you should be making. Of course, nobody makes the ACE9 shove, so obviously you should be making these adjustments, but we'll get to that, like I said, down the line. So yeah, you need to know what kind of mistakes people can make.

S

Speaker

34:22 - 34:46

You need to know how to take advantage of these mistakes in a good and effective way. And you need to recognize the mistakes that your opponents are making. So I might have messed up the order, but I'd say know what kind of mistakes are possible to make. Recognize which mistakes your opponents are making and know what to do about it. Those are the three bases of exploitative poker.


Speaker

34:46 - 34:57

gonna try to touch on those again over and over again across a lot of different spots in poker in this course i think that does it for the introductory video see you guys in the next one
