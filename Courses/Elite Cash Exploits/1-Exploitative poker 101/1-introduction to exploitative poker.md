My summary:
Exploitative poker is all about:
1. Knowing what mistakes are possible
2. Recognizing when opponents are doing those
3. Know how to deviate
It treats every player as if he's a rec, and that's the best way to move up the ladder of poker.

## Introduction & Course Structure

>Hey everyone, I want to start out this course by talking about why exploit. This wasn't an easy decision to start out talking about and I want to throw out a caveat that structuring this course was kind of difficult with exploitation. There are a lot of interconnected parts. It's not a subject you can study linearly because as I'm talking about why exploit, you guys don't necessarily think of exploit in the same way I do.
> 
> and you can't really understand exploitation without understanding what GTO is and you guys don't necessarily think of GTO in the same way I do and all these things are gonna come so please bear with me if some of the stuff I'm saying doesn't make sense right away we are gonna cover everything. I want to start out with why exploit? It's really important for you guys to understand why and to be convinced that this is a good way to play.

## The Nature of Exploitative Poker: Risk vs. Reward

> because very different from other forms of poker when you're playing exploitative poker you're going out on a limb and you're taking big risks the very nature of exploitative poker is that you gain more win rate by risking more win rate if we're doing a fight metaphor you're like throwing a big punch but you're leaving yourself vulnerable and if the other guy knows what's going on you're in trouble.
> 
> So you have to be very very accurate with what you're doing and you have to be convinced it works. Very often when I work with students they learn this stuff but it takes them a long time to feel the confidence to actually execute it. So very often they have this aha moment after a few months and then their win rate in their game start changing. But until then they're studying all this stuff but they can't really follow through in the moment just because it's so scary. It's very important that you're internally convinced about what you're doing because exploiting can lead you to make very crazy plays and very risky plays. It's very easy for someone to say: "hmm you know I don't really want to do this".
> 
> "Why not just follow the GTO chart and use my random number generator, do some kind of balance strategy, only bluff the bottom of my range, only call the correct bluff catcher?" Like, why shouldn't I just do that? And you can of course just do that. But I'm gonna show you guys over and over again during this course how that would be leaving money on the table. Not something you want to do when you're playing poker, you don't want to leave money at the table. We want all the money.

## A Chess Metaphor for Exploitation

> Okay, so with that, I'm going to start out by giving you guys a metaphor, a chess metaphor, actually. The chess opening is like a scripted series of moves in the beginning of the game. And the reason it's scripted is because chess has been so researched that when one player starts in a certain way, everyone knows what the first correct 20 moves are going to be. And after those moves, you start having options and you start playing chess. As you're playing, especially when you're playing at a non-expert level, very often your opponent will not know the correct scripted moves in an opening. So you'll start out with a script that you've been taught and somewhere, you know, maybe the second move, maybe the eighth move, your opponent will make a different move than the one in the script. And here different is going to be generally an inferior move.
> 
> Now, the way I view exploitative poker... is that rather than focusing on the script of the opening water, the correct 20 moves, our focus is on what do I do whenever my opponent blunders. So in a way when you're studying exploitative poker, you do of course learn the correct 20 moves, but you learn them in a much deeper way than you would if you were just learning the opening because every move you understand on a deep level what's the reason to make the move but you also understand like every little mistake your opponent makes what you do against it... In my eyes this is exploitative poker.

## How Solvers Work

> I know not everyone who's purchased the course necessarily has worked with solvers, so I'll try to make this both short and simple... what happens as it's iterating is each player is going to try to exploit the other player's strategy... the idea is each player is calculating like the best possible strategy against the other player. You do this over and over and over and over again. And each time the strategies get more difficult to exploit until at some point we reach this thing called a Nash equilibrium where neither player can change anything about his strategy in order to exploit the other one more.
> 
> So solvers start out with everything random, they go exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit, exploit. Once they're done with this... they're like, okay, this is the way to play. And that's how most people play. But we're going to be focused on the exploit-exploit part of the solver, which is a big, big part of what's going on here. You can look at the final solution and be like, okay, I want to just do this, but you're missing out on the reasons that everything is there and you're missing out on... what if my opponent is not playing like this what should I do about it the answer is in the same computer program but you're not necessarily trained to look for it or look at it.

## Practical Examples of Exploitation

### Example 1: Exploiting an Over-Folder

> let's say we're playing against someone and we know that this player doesn't like bluff catching very much... he's not going to call you with ace4 and ace5. He's not going to call you with ace9, ace10, and ace jack...
> 
> I want to compare this to let's say for example that you know I've been playing with this guy for a while I have a strong suspicion he doesn't know how to bluff catch so I'm gonna go ahead and assume he doesn't and then on the river anything I get to the river with it can't beat the king I'm just gonna fire away...
> 
> Now what happened to his EV now is $647.56. You guys can see how dramatic a difference this is. And this is in a nutshell what exploitative poker is. You could say, I'll just play GTO... But when you're doing that, you're in a race against everyone else who's also doing that. And it's just not the best way to play because... face the facts, the people you're playing with in poker... He's not good enough because he's making mistakes. And it's up to us to find the mistakes, make him pay for them, and then move up the stakes at his expense.

### Example 2: Exploiting a Lack of Donk Betting

> What we could do for a different kind of example is maybe donk betting... the out of position player, is supposed to donk bet. He's supposed to donk bet shop with king-queen... Not everyone does this. There are a bunch of players who you play with. They're gonna get to this river, they're not really gonna think about donk betting. They're gonna auto-check...
> 
> ...if we look at in position EV now, position EV goes up to 374.4. So not nearly as dramatic of a difference as we had before, because it's not as dramatic of a mistake. But these kind of mistakes can be more or less dramatic... this is another example of, you know, if your opponent knows how to play perfectly, you know how to play perfectly. Good luck to both of you playing nosebleeds. But most cases... you know that there are guys who don't donk bet against those guys. You have to be a bit more careful with what you're doing on the river.

## Understanding GTO (Game Theory Optimal)

### The History of GTO

> The way GTO used to be perceived was similar to balance... the idea was nobody really knew what they were doing and people would get into these leveling wars. You know, should I bluff or shouldn't I bluff? Is he going to call or isn't he going to call? Is he bluffing or isn't he bluffing? and it would get into a big guessing game... but then people came up with this idea of GTO you know if I make a pot-sized riverbed and for every two value bets I have, I have one bluff. What are you gonna do about it?... by getting to this kind of balanced point with my range, I'm forcing you into a situation where the EV of all your bluff catchers is zero... Like if I'm balanced, I'm invincible. This is the history of GTO.

### Modern GTO

> modern GTO is based on studying with solvers and with computers and having these kind of exploit, counter-exploit, endgame strategies that are in a way unbeatable and have all this crazy stuff going on in them... GTO also includes a ton of really advanced concepts... and it also includes understanding how thin and how big you can value bet in every spot.
> 
> GTO perfect poker right like you realize everything you have all the perfect frequencies to make your opponent not able to exploit you but you're also very very accurate.

## When NOT to Play GTO

> The common answer to this, and I think this is almost universally accepted by players, is that whenever you're playing against a recreational, you don't play GTO. Like, it's a waste of time. The recreational player has a weak enough game where you can understand how he's going to react to certain things... we don't go for GTO, we go for pure exploitative poker for the most part versus recreational players. I think this is generally accepted and anything else would be leaving money on the table.
> 
> Recreational player at the end of the day, what we mean when we say, you know, this guy's bad enough, I don't need to play GTO against him. What we mean is that this is a player who is making mistakes that I can see and predict, I know how to do something about them, and I understand poker better than he does...

## The Poker Mountain & "Bum Hunting" Regulars

> as you climb the poker mountain, when you have an exploitative standpoint, an exploitative approach to the game, you're treating more and more players and more and more situations as recreationals. There is a term in poker that's looked down on by some people called bum hunting which is like, you know, you hunt the weaker players, but if you become a strong exploitative player, everyone around you is a weaker player. Like you can bum hunt regulars. And I was throughout my career constantly bum hunting regulars. Like I wouldn't need a recreational at the table because if I know... that someone is, you know, over-folding in a bunch of spots, I knew how to structure my game in a way where money would flow very quickly from him to me.

## The Three Pillars of Exploitative Poker

> So the three bases that you need in order to play good exploitative poker.
> 
> 1. Number one, you need to know what kind of mistakes are possible to make in poker. The more mistakes you know, the stronger your exploitative game is going to be.
>     
> 2. You need to know how to take advantage of these mistakes in a good and effective way.
>     
> 3. And you need to recognize the mistakes that your opponents are making.
>     
> 
> So I might have messed up the order, but I'd say know what kind of mistakes are possible to make. Recognize which mistakes your opponents are making and know what to do about it. Those are the three bases of exploitative poker.

## Conclusion

> gonna try to touch on those again over and over again across a lot of different spots in poker in this course i think that does it for the introductory video see you guys in the next one.
