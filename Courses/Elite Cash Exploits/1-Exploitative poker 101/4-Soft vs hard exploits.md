### My Summary:

Hard exploits are maximizing EV but risking discoverability (for example, 3-betting 100% of the time as BB vs a BU who folds too much).  
Soft exploits are just taking hands that are marginal (mixing/low EV loss) and 3-betting them for example. While some players love hard exploits and don't mind being discovered as they don't mind going into a leveling war (which requires more focus in-game), Uri likes soft exploits because it doesn't risk discoverability.

## Defining the Concepts

> Okay, so in this chapter I'm going to talk about different ways in which you can structure exploitative strategies. And the titles I call this are hard exploiting versus soft exploiting. Now to explain the terms, hard exploiting is exploiting someone to the absolute maximum that you can. For example, if someone is over-folding in a spot, you will bluff every single combo, even ones with tons of showdown value, whatever makes you money, you just do it.
> 
> Soft exploit is more a kind of silent but deadly style. I guess a good example would be preflop... Let's say that I'm opening the button... And I know the big blind is overfolding to an extent where I can open any two cards profitably. A hard exploit would be to open everything. A soft exploit would be to open a bit wider than this, so all the mixes 100%, maybe add a bit more on top and leave it there.

## The Risk of Discovery

> The idea of course is that hard exploit makes you more money, but it risks discovery a lot more. As long as you're kind of playing within the mixes, it's very tough for people to know what you're doing. But with a hard exploit, if I open 10-5 off and this goes to showdown in some way, I don't know if my opponent is going to adjust or not and maybe I've kind of burned my exploit. Like, am I going to feel comfortable opening too much anymore for a while? And how will I know if my opponent noticed and if he adjusted or if he didn't?

## A Mathematical Example: The Danger of Hard Exploits

> The example I want to talk about is kind of a toy game example... we're talking about a 4-bet, 5-bet spot... Now, I know that your 4-betting range overfolds to 5-bets by 4%. So every 5-bet bluff I make makes me $10... We play this spot 30 times and I always 5-bet, I win $10 of EV every single time.
> 
> But what happens to my EV if you catch on to what I'm doing and you know that I'm always 5-betting with all my bluffs? If you know, you would just stop 4-bet bluffing... The 31st time that you 4-bet me, you have a pure value range. You're always calling. And like always, I am always bluffing. And at this point... I now lose $400.
> 
> So this is kind of the issue with hard exploiting is that when you're hard exploiting a small leak, getting discovered is very very very risky... the small edges that you're gaining add up, but they can disappear really, really, really fast.

## Strategic Approach: Sustaining Your Edge

> Generally, what you want to be doing when you're doing soft versus hard exploits is if it's a once-in-a-lifetime spot, go ahead and do the hard exploit if you're never going to play with a guy again, obviously. But any spot that repeats itself and guys that you're playing with over and over, you want to be very careful and try to sustain your edge. And this is my approach.

### The Alternative: Leveling Wars

> I do have a friend whose approach was always to go for the max hard exploit. And he wouldn't care if people saw because he loved these leveling wars. He was like, okay, you're going to see that I five bet bluffed you with some random shitty hand. I know how you're going to adjust. I'm going to be one step ahead of you all the time. Now, this is a very legitimate approach. You need to be a lot more focused to pull it off.
> 
> So my preference is, I guess, in a way, kind of more lazy. I want to exploit in a way where no one's ever going to know that anything's going on. And then I don't need to keep track and worry about stuff.

## Practical Application: Adjusting Preflop Ranges

> Let's say that you're in a big blind and you know button is folding too much to 3-bets... you could 3-bet this [any two cards]. This would be the hard exploit, right? And presumably this would work great, but it's very easy to notice and I think way too extreme.
> 
> A nicer way of doing this would be to take... a 3-bet range that seems reasonable... I want to 3-bet more, but not in an extreme way. So let's add 4-5 and 4-3. Let's add suited gappers. We'll add some more pocket pairs... you could get to 26% rather than 15%, so you are exploiting your opponent quite a lot. But you're doing it in a soft way where none of the hands that you're showing now are extreme enough where they should make him pick up and take notice.
> 
> Now, there is a step further you could take this... a step further would be, well, you know, this guy is overfolding, so let's do less value. We'll cut out some of the good hands and just throw in extra bluffs.

## Conclusion

> Again, it's a simple concept, hard exploiting versus soft exploiting. It's important to know it's going to come up a lot down the line. So I needed to put it out there and I think with that we can move forwards.
