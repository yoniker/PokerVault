In this video I want to talk a bit about using HUD stats and how numbers and how statistics work. Obviously not everyone watching this course is using a HUD, but one of the things we're going to learn is both how to use one and how to use one effectively, but also how other people might be using it, what mistakes it might cause. So I think this is going to be relevant even for those of you who are not planning to use a HUD.

S

Speaker

00:29 - 00:51

and if if you don't like using a hud for whatever reason hopefully this shows you maybe a nicer way than you'd imagine the less intimidating way of using one which is i think the correct way of using okay so what's wrong with the way most people use huds so to start out

S

Speaker

00:51 - 01:09

I have to tell the statistics story which I always tell in these kind of situations. Statistics is a subject that can be very misleading, works very different from people's intuitions. Okay, so the situation is 1% of the population has this very rare disease

S

Speaker

01:08 - 01:33

And we have a very accurate test for telling if someone has a disease or not. It's actually 99% accurate. So this guy Sam goes, he gets tested, and the test says positive, you have disease A. What is the chance that he actually has the disease? This is kind of a misleading question, because the intuition for most people would be to say,

S

Speaker

01:34 - 02:01

Well, if the test is 99% accurate and the test is positive, then obviously the chance he has a disease is 99%. Why would it be anything else is a good question. And to do that, to answer it, we're going to have to start digging a bit into how unintuitively statistics work. So let's say 100 people who were to get tested. Out of these, with a 99% accurate test,

S

Speaker

02:01 - 02:30

we'd have one false positive. Like 1% of the time the test gives the wrong result, so out of 100 people we'd have one wrong result. Now out of 100 people, because 1 in 100 people has the disease, we'd probably get one correct positive. So for every 100 people you test, you're on average gonna get two positive answers, one of them correct and one of them incorrect.

S

Speaker

02:30 - 02:54

And this means that the chance that someone who tests positive is actually positive for the disease is actually 50%, not 99%. This is very, very unintuitive, and it's very strongly connected to how you use HUD stats. Now, before we move on to actually how you actually use HUD stats, there is another

S

Speaker

02:55 - 03:16

statistical story that we need to talk about and this is actually connected to a poker story. I'll start out with a poker story. This is actually about Zaza. If you guys know him, old school grinder, made it all the way up to high stakes. I have no clue what he's doing these days. Probably still playing poker in one way or another but very very smart guy.

S

Speaker

03:17 - 03:36

And Zaza was doing a database analysis and he was looking at the EVs he has with all sorts of hands in all sorts of situations. And he looked and he told me, you know, I'm losing money opening offsuit aces and pocket pairs from the button.

S

Speaker

03:36 - 03:52

just losing money so I'm gonna work on that part of my game we were talking about like what do you want to do what do you want to work on he was looking through his database saw this and he was like okay this is what I need to work on and this is connected to a lot of guys

S

Speaker

03:53 - 04:21

When they want to work on their game, they're like, okay, what's my win rate by position? We're talking guys who use tracking software, of course. If you don't, you're not going to know what I'm talking about. But they look, what's my win rate by position? What's my win rate by hand type? What's my win rate in three-bet pots? What's my win rate in four-bet pots? Keep going with all of these things, and they look for a spot where the win rate isn't as high as it should be. And that's the spot they work on.

S

Speaker

04:22 - 04:39

Now, this is a very, very wrong way to go about things. And the reason, again, is kind of unintuitive. And it has to do with statistics, and it has to do with how you use huds. Let's say I have a huge sample size, right? I have a database of like 500,000 hits.

S

Speaker

04:40 - 04:57

And I think that each of the stats in my database is 99% accurate. Now I start digging through all these stats to look for outliers, to look for something that's wrong. I'm looking through hundreds of numbers. Let's make this...

S

Speaker

04:57 - 05:25

95% accurate. Here again, for every 20 numbers I look through, I'm gonna get a false positive if the numbers are 95% accurate. I'm gonna get a hand type that's losing, or a position or a spot where I'm not doing well enough, where it's actually just random statistical noise. And the reason I get this statistical noise is that I'm looking at too many numbers. And once you start looking at a lot of numbers,

S

Speaker

05:26 - 05:31

Some of them are going to be off when things aren't off 100% accurate.

S

Speaker

05:31 - 05:55

And this is just the way of the world. And then when you see a number that's off, and you're like, "Oh, you know, this guy has a big leak right here, like he's over-folding massively on turns in 3-bet pots, let's pound him there." But there is no leak anywhere else. You can bet your house it's statistical noise. You're looking at 40 different numbers, one of them's gonna be off.

S

Speaker

05:56 - 06:09

If you base your game and your game plan on looking through these numbers, looking for the number that's off and attacking that number, and you don't know what you're doing very very accurately with math, you're wasting your energy,

S

Speaker

06:09 - 06:31

and you're also exploiting in a bad way, right? You're picking a spot to exploit that's actually probably incorrect, and you're taking the exploit risk without getting any of the reward. Now, most of the time, if you start over-bluffing him on the turn, whatever, he's probably just defending GTO, so it doesn't cost you anything.

S

Speaker

06:31 - 06:49

It costs you lots of energy. Maybe most of the time in big decisions, you're digging through all these numbers. Oh, what do I do? What do I do? What's the HUD going to tell me to do? Rather than actually think about everything else that there is to think about. And there's a ton of other things to think about other than these numbers.

S

Speaker

06:50 - 07:15

What you guys have here is an Excel sheet that I had developed years and years ago. And the idea here was to start solving some of these statistical issues by understanding what types of sample sizes do we actually need in order to be certain about a stat. Something you might hear people say about numbers is

S

Speaker

07:15 - 07:21

You know, I know it's a low sample size, but this number is all I've got. It's better than nothing.

S

Speaker

07:22 - 07:48

Now that's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. It's not better than nothing. It's worse than nothing because it's random noise and random noise is not better than nothing. As a poker player, you have better stuff than random noise to base your decisions on, or at least so I would hope. So a very common statistic that professional players like to look at in 6-max is a $1 when saw flop.

S

Speaker

07:49 - 08:20

Now, $1 when saw flop indicates how often when a player sees a flop he actually ends up winning. If it's 49 to 50 it's a very aggressive guy. If it's 51 plus it's an insanely aggressive guy. If it's, you know, 46 or lower it's a very passive guy. And 47 to 48 is like average regret.

S

Speaker

08:20 - 08:45

So this is a number that kind of has a lot of post flop things inside, but overall it tells you how often a guy is trying to win pots. So on the surface you use this, you look at someone, you have a big amount of hands on them, you look at this number and you're like "okay, this guy's aggro, I'm gonna call him down. This guy's passive, I'm gonna fold." Like you can use these kind of numbers to make decisions.

S

Speaker

08:45 - 09:12

And this is again what a lot of professional players are doing. One very basic issue with this is that as a player gets tighter preflop, he's going to get to the flop with a stronger range and he's going to win more flops. So this number is correlated to your VPIP. Looser players should have a lower 1/1 soft flop. And if you're looking at this number in a vacuum, it can be very misleading.

S

Speaker

09:13 - 09:42

For example, a 5 VP/IP player might have an insanely high 1/1 soft flop, and this doesn't mean he's necessarily being aggressive, he just has overpairs all the time. You don't want to start calling him down. So first of all, you need to see the big picture. Let's talk about the 25 VP/IP player. So here, preflop 100% of the time. We don't care about what position the guy is in, so we'll write "any". This situation is...

S

Speaker

09:42 - 09:52

sees a flop, sees a flop, happens with 25 VPIP, it happens

S

Speaker

09:53 - 10:19

25% of the time that you put in money. But some of these times you're going to see folds. Let's say that the times you see a flop, we can actually just pull them from random hold and integer. So roughly 20% seeing a flop. And this includes some heads up hands, but obviously that differs based on your game time. Everyone can do this test on their own.

S

Speaker

10:19 - 10:48

So 20% of the time we see a flop, and once we've seen the flop, anything, right? Anything goes. So basically 20% of hands that we play, and we want to put the average kind of population percent here, we'll put in 48. So 20%, we have 100, 20, 100, 48 is the estimated amount, and we can see that the program says a chance to get into this situation is 20%, which is correct.

S

Speaker

10:48 - 11:13

Now, what margin of error are we okay with for the number? Margin of error means... Sorry, let me actually make this a bit longer, because we also have a confidence level. So margin of error is the margin within we're okay with being at a certain confidence level. So for those of you who don't know statistics,

S

Speaker

11:14 - 11:31

Let's say that I'm okay with being 80% confident about the number being between 48 and 49, which would mean a margin of error of 0.5% because we're going 0.5% in each direction.

S

Speaker

11:32 - 11:58

Now, how would we determine which margin of error we're looking for? Well, the question is, is there a difference between 49 and 50 and 51? And here I would say, you know, jumps of two are different because we're treating 49 and 47 and 45 differently. Jumps of one we can probably deal with. So we can maybe put out a margin of error of 1%. And

S

Speaker

11:58 - 12:25

How big of a confidence level you're okay with to make adjustments? I don't know how to tell you guys which number to put in here. You need some kind of reasonable confidence level. We're talking sciences and social studies. People go with 95%. But in poker, you know, you could say, how big is the adjustment going to be? To make a big one, I need a large confidence level. To make a small one, I need a small confidence level.

S

Speaker

12:26 - 12:53

So maybe 80% is good enough or even 70% is good enough. Now how many hands do you need to tell someone's 1-1 softlock with a 1% margin of error, 70% confidence level? The answer is 13,400 hands. Anything less than that, the margin of error gets so big that the stat is rubbish and you can't use it. Now

S

Speaker

12:54 - 13:03

13,000 hands is a lot of hands. To play 13,000 hands with someone, you probably play them for months.

S

Speaker

13:04 - 13:26

And most people start using the HUD straight away, maybe after 500 hands, maybe after 1,000 hands. Maybe you're like, no, I want a big sample. I'm going to wait for 2,000 hands. And then you look and you see someone with 4511 soft law and you don't realize, A, you know, with 2,000 hands, we're talking...

S

Speaker

13:27 - 13:43

like 2.5% margin of error. So 47.5% 1-1 soft flop might be 45%. The guy with 46% might have 48.5%. Pretty much useless for most people.

S

Speaker

13:44 - 14:12

See, you don't realize that as a first thing. And second thing is you don't realize you're looking at the stats of every single player that you're playing with, right? So we said 70% confidence level. If you look at 10 different huds of 10 different players, you're going to get three false positives. And the thing about hud stats is that generally the outliers are the ones that make you make adjustments. So this is very, very dangerous.

S

Speaker

14:13 - 14:36

Very dangerous way to use a HUD is just to put stats in, wait for 2000 hands and look at the stats. It's a terrible way to use a HUD and it's the way most people use a HUD. Now, this is a course about exploiting, so I'm not going to tell you guys don't use a HUD. A HUD gives you information and we want information.

S

Speaker

14:36 - 15:04

in order to make exploitative decisions. Otherwise, we just play GTO. But we need to be intelligent about the way we use the information if we want to gain win rate from it. Because if we just look at HUD stats with low samples, and we look at multiple players, and whenever there's an outlier, it pushes us to make a decision, we're spending a lot of energy and a lot of time, and it's probably costing us more money than it's winning us.

S

Speaker

15:05 - 15:26

We might still be winning players, but it's not because of this, it's despite this. Okay. I want to look at a few more stats to show you guys the numbers and to show you guys how this cheat can be used. And then we'll get to talking about how to actually use hot stats. Okay, so...

S

Speaker

15:27 - 15:52

Some other numbers we might want: Fold button to big blind 3-bet, very useful stat. Again, a lot of professional players have these complicated displays: position versus position, fold to 3-bet. You get this beautiful chart and if you know what numbers you're looking for, maybe you see someone over-folding, you start over-bluffing, it feels really good. But what kind of sample do you need to not fall into these traps?

S

Speaker

15:53 - 16:20

Let's say that we're talking about a margin of error with fold to 3 bet of say 5%. I don't know if 5% is okay. Depends on how big of an overfold you're going for, but maybe we can be 5%. Now how often do we get into this situation? So preflop every time. Position the player has to be on the button. Now in a six-handed game,

S

Speaker

16:21 - 16:46

You're going to be on the button roughly 17% of the time. The situation is opens and faces is 3-bet. This is the situation. Now, how often do you open button? I did this rough calculation here years ago. I got 23%. The idea is that in order to open a button,

S

Speaker

16:46 - 17:18

You need, maybe open like a 42 or 50% range, but you also need everyone before you to fold. So these are not accurate numbers, but they're, they're, they're close enough because there's lots of inaccuracies here. So we open buttons, say 23% all around that to roughly 20% or not. We'll see as we go along. And then how often do you face a three bet? Say 15% from the big blind and, uh,

S

Speaker

17:19 - 17:47

We want to know the fold, say, to a 3-bet maybe from any of the blinds because we don't care which one it is. So let's say 15% from the small blind as well. Aggressive players, probably less. Let's say both together, 3-bet average 25%. So we open the button 23%. One quarter of those, we face a 3-bet. And so opening and facing a 3-bet ends up being roughly 6% of the time.

S

Speaker

17:47 - 18:03

And let's say the estimated fold to 3-bet is going to be... And here we don't even have to guess as we have these beautiful Monkerson's small blind 3-bet. You guys can see here we have a really big 3-bet it looks like. So 64% folds.

S

Speaker

18:03 - 18:23

Now, you're looking at fold to 3-bets, you're looking at all the positions, you're looking at all the opponents, you can't go with a 70% confidence interval. You need at least 95% because these are stats that you just look at non-stop multiple times per player if you're using these. So number of hands you need for the 5% margin of error.

S

Speaker

18:23 - 18:53

35,000 hints and you're still going to fall into the trap of looking at too many numbers. So again, very, very tough to use. Very tough to use these stats, which brings us into an issue, right? Like we want to be good exploitative players and to do that, we need information, right? We talked in the introductory video about our opponent overfolding. How do I know that my opponent overfolds? I just pay attention to everything and write everything down and

S

Speaker

18:53 - 19:18

and I haven't seen him call, does that even mean anything? You know, maybe he would call the next time. Some hands don't even see a showdown when someone calls and loses and maybe you're playing too many tables, maybe you're at the casino, you went out for a drink and live poker, the pace is so slow it will take you years like to get 35,000 hands on someone in a live setting,

S

Speaker

19:19 - 19:38

not going to happen in a lifetime. I'm not sure if it's possible, but hopefully it is possible to share this Excel sheet on the upswing poker site. If it is, I'll try to walk you guys through the way this works again. So the

S

Speaker

19:39 - 20:05

Gray boxes are the boxes where we can edit stuff and we don't touch the white boxes. The white boxes are calculated by formulas. So we play with margin of error and confidence level. I'd urge you guys to have a very high confidence level if it's a stat that you look at a lot. You know, it's very easy to say, ah, it's poker, you know, we're gambling, we're guessing 70% is good enough.

S

Speaker

20:06 - 20:35

But if you say that, you run into the problem where when you look at 10 people, you get 3 false positives. And guys, how many false positives are you going to get? If you go back to the story, like how many people are massively over-folding the turn? Not as many as the number of false positives you guys are going to get if you use a low confidence level. Margin of error that you're okay with depends on the stat and how you're using it. So 1-1 soft flop, you need a really small one.

S

Speaker

20:36 - 21:03

Volt to 3-bet may be a larger one. C-bet percent may be even larger. Who knows? Really depends on which way you're going to use the stat. We are going to learn how to use stats in this course for what it's worth in a better way than this. Now, here, all of these fields are just for ease of reference for you guys. Like, you could just put the final number somewhere, right? Like,

S

Speaker

21:03 - 21:30

you could put 100, 100, 100, and just 1% somewhere. But the idea here is for the percent to get into the situation to be calculated correctly. And like you guys can see, in some kind of spots like this button opens and faces a 3-bet spot, you need 355 hands sample to get the confidence level margin of error we're talking about.

S

Speaker

21:30 - 21:57

But the spot is so rare, it doesn't sound rare, but it needs to get folded to the button and you open and you face a 3-bet. And that happens 1 in 100 hands. So you need 35,000 hands. And if we were being more strict with a margin of error, like 2%, you'd need fucking 220,000 hands. These calculations on the button, they were made a while ago. You guys can see here, buttons raised first 50%.

S

Speaker

21:57 - 22:26

Feel free to make your own or get them from a database if you want high accuracy. But in my eyes, this sheet is more to show that you need infinite hands and you can't use huds in the old-fashioned way. I don't think it's very important to see which sample you need for which stat, etc. Because the real conclusion from this is that you're very rarely going to have enough hands and using huds in this way is just not very useful.

S

Speaker

22:27 - 22:52

Even heads up where hands get collected very, very fast. If you have 20 stats in your HUD, you're running into all the same problems I was discussing, right? Like what confidence level are you okay with? Just as an example of a heads up stat, let's say heads up fold to three bets. You're like, oh, this guy's over folding to three bets or over folding to four bets or whatever.

S

Speaker

22:54 - 23:15

Heads up to get into the situation of facing a 3-bet. The guy needs to be on the button, that's half the time. And then he needs to have raised, so say 80% of the time, and then face a 3-bet, say 20% of the time. So 16. And let's say that he's meant to fold...

S

Speaker

23:15 - 23:44

50% of the time to a 3-bet and you're okay with like a 4% margin of error and you're looking at more stats so you need 95% confidence interval. We're again talking about 7,500 hands in order to get into a spot where you can use the stat. You can't use it after 1,000. You can't use it after 2,000. You need a lot of hands in order to use stats in heads up. And keep in mind

S

Speaker

23:45 - 23:55

you know player profiling like if all the stats fit you know he's not opening enough he's not c-betting correct sizings like it's clear the guy hasn't studied

S

Speaker

23:55 - 24:20

it's a lot more likely that he is actually folding too much. But if it's a professional player who's doing everything right and you guys see one or two hot leaks, they are most likely noise unless you have huge, huge samples. So what are we actually going to do with these tools? The answer I came up with is that we use these tools to profile players.

S

Speaker

24:21 - 24:37

So rather than looking for specific numbers, we actually want to look at all the numbers together and we use the numbers to form a player profile. So for example, someone who is over-folding

S

Speaker

24:38 - 24:56

I would look for a bunch of numbers that all indicate overfolding. Generally someone who overfolds in one situation overfolds across the board. So if I look at Ahad and I see, oh, this player is overfolding the turn, but he's actually calling correctly everywhere else.

S

Speaker

24:57 - 25:24

I would say this player, for me, he's not overfolding the turn, he's playing turn 5. If I see someone who's folding too much button versus big blind to 3-bets, but he has the correct VPIP PFR, he has a decent c-bet amount, there's no other clear overfold anywhere else or very rare, then I'd treat it as random noise.

S

Speaker

25:25 - 25:48

What I'm looking for is kind of across the board, putting several statistics together. In this way, rather than having damage by looking at 20 numbers, I actually use the numbers to reinforce each other. I'm not looking for a specific number. I don't care about margin of error and I don't care about confidence level when I look at multiple numbers because

S

Speaker

25:48 - 26:13

I'm looking for a coherent picture of an individual, I'm actually willing to brush aside numbers that don't fit, and once I understand the player archetype, I can actually guess at numbers that I don't have the sample size and don't have the information on. And if we go back to kind of the pillars of exploiting, how do you exploit, we said that we want to know what kind of mistakes people

S

Speaker

26:13 - 26:37

can make, and we want to recognize what kind of mistakes people are making. I think hard use is a very, very big spot where a lot of people are making a lot of mistakes regarding information gathering. They want to be good exploitative players, but they don't understand the statistics of the situation well enough.

S

Speaker

26:37 - 27:00

Like I said, being an exploitative player is not the same as being a GTO player. You don't necessarily need to know math to be a GTO player, but you kind of do to exploit. The correct way, in my eyes, and the way that we're going to study in this course is we're going to talk about various different player archetypes.

S

Speaker

27:01 - 27:19

how to recognize those and once you recognize a player archetype you're already going to know which adjustments and how you want to play against that player archetype so we're no longer looking oh this stat is in this range i'm going to play in this way or no like this guy's a nit i'm

S

Speaker

27:19 - 27:46

I'm going to bluff him in this way, and this way, and this way. I'm going to adjust preflop in that way. I'm going to change my sizings in this way, and so on and so forth. And hopefully, you know, our assessments will be more accurate, and our adjustments will be more accurate, because we'll, you know, you can see one thing and adjust to four other things that you haven't seen when you're working with archetypes, rather than working with statistics. Anyone who doesn't use HOTS,

S

Speaker

27:46 - 28:08

This should kind of tell you that you don't need to. Most of the guys that are using huds against you that haven't watched this course are just using them really badly. They're wasting time and they're wasting energy and you don't need to be afraid of hud users. They're just doing it badly. Over time my hud has actually gotten smaller and smaller.

S

Speaker

28:08 - 28:32

for cash games. So yeah, most people are using hudspaddle, you don't need to be worried about it. If you don't like huds and numbers and statistics, you don't have to use one. But since you're with me in this course, I am going to show you how to use it in a way where you actually don't need to look at tons of numbers and you're using it in a more holistic way to profile players and

S

Speaker

28:32 - 28:51

I think it's a lot nicer than looking at a bunch of numbers. I had a friend whose HUD looked like the matrix. All his screen was millions of numbers. We're not going to do that at all. It's going to be very simple, very effective, and very fun. And win you guys more money.
