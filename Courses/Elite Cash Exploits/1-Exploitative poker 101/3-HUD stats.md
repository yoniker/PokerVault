### My summary:

Specific HUD stats are VERY misleading and counter-intuitive.  
Don't use the advanced HUD stats like "overfolds to turn bet" unless I'm sure and I have a HUGE sample (I need to look into it if I decided to do it).  
Instead, what I should do with them is take those as a group, and profile players based on several of the stats.

## Introduction: The Relevance of HUDs

> In this video I want to talk a bit about using HUD stats and how numbers and how statistics work. Obviously not everyone watching this course is using a HUD, but one of the things we're going to learn is both how to use one and how to use one effectively, but also how other people might be using it, what mistakes it might cause. So I think this is going to be relevant even for those of you who are not planning to use a HUD.
> 
> and if you don't like using a HUD for whatever reason hopefully this shows you maybe a nicer way than you'd imagine the less intimidating way of using one which is I think the correct way of using okay so what's wrong with the way most people use HUDs.

## The Counter-Intuitive Nature of Statistics

> To start out, I have to tell the statistics story which I always tell in these kind of situations. Statistics is a subject that can be very misleading, works very different from people's intuitions. Okay, so the situation is 1% of the population has this very rare disease and we have a very accurate test for telling if someone has a disease or not. It's actually 99% accurate. So this guy Sam goes, he gets tested, and the test says positive, you have disease A. What is the chance that he actually has the disease?
> 
> The intuition for most people would be to say, well, if the test is 99% accurate and the test is positive, then obviously the chance he has a disease is 99%. ... to answer it, we're going to have to start digging a bit into how unintuitively statistics work. So let's say 100 people were to get tested. Out of these, with a 99% accurate test, we'd have one false positive... Now out of 100 people, because 1 in 100 people has the disease, we'd probably get one correct positive. So for every 100 people you test, you're on average gonna get two positive answers, one of them correct and one of them incorrect. And this means that the chance that someone who tests positive is actually positive for the disease is actually 50%, not 99%. This is very, very unintuitive, and it's very strongly connected to how you use HUD stats.

## The Danger of Data Mining Your Own Game

> This is actually about Zaza. If you guys know him, old school grinder, made it all the way up to high stakes... Zaza was doing a database analysis... and he told me, you know, I'm losing money opening offsuit aces and pocket pairs from the button just losing money so I'm gonna work on that part of my game.
> 
> When they want to work on their game, they're like, okay, what's my win rate by position?... What's my win rate in three-bet pots?... and they look for a spot where the win rate isn't as high as it should be. And that's the spot they work on. Now, this is a very, very wrong way to go about things.
> 
> Let's say I have a huge sample size, right? I have a database of like 500,000 hands and I think that each of the stats in my database is 95% accurate. Here again, for every 20 numbers I look through, I'm gonna get a false positive... I'm gonna get a hand type that's losing, or a position or a spot where I'm not doing well enough, where it's actually just random statistical noise. And the reason I get this statistical noise is that I'm looking at too many numbers.

## Applying Statistical Traps to HUDs

> And then when you see a number that's off, and you're like, "Oh, you know, this guy has a big leak right here, like he's over-folding massively on turns in 3-bet pots, let's pound him there." But there is no leak anywhere else. You can bet your house it's statistical noise. You're looking at 40 different numbers, one of them's gonna be off.
> 
> If you base your game and your game plan on looking through these numbers, looking for the number that's off and attacking that number, and you don't know what you're doing very very accurately with math, you're wasting your energy, and you're also exploiting in a bad way, right? You're picking a spot to exploit that's actually probably incorrect, and you're taking the exploit risk without getting any of the reward.

## Sample Size: The Sobering Reality

> Something you might hear people say about numbers is, "You know, I know it's a low sample size, but this number is all I've got. It's better than nothing." Now that's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. It's not better than nothing. It's worse than nothing because it's random noise and random noise is not better than nothing.
> 
> So a very common statistic that professional players like to look at in 6-max is a "Won When Saw Flop" percentage... this is a number that kind of has a lot of post flop things inside, but overall it tells you how often a guy is trying to win pots... One very basic issue with this is that as a player gets tighter preflop, he's going to get to the flop with a stronger range and he's going to win more flops. So this number is correlated to your VPIP. Looser players should have a lower Won When Saw Flop. And if you're looking at this number in a vacuum, it can be very misleading.
> 
> Now how many hands do you need to tell someone's Won When Saw Flop with a 1% margin of error, 70% confidence level? The answer is 13,400 hands. Anything less than that, the margin of error gets so big that the stat is rubbish and you can't use it. Now 13,000 hands is a lot of hands. To play 13,000 hands with someone, you probably play with them for months. And most people start using the HUD straight away, maybe after 500 hands, maybe after 1,000 hands...
> 
> A very dangerous way to use a HUD is just to put stats in, wait for 2000 hands and look at the stats. It's a terrible way to use a HUD and it's the way most people use a HUD.

### Example: Fold to 3-Bet Stat

> Some other numbers we might want: Fold button to big blind 3-bet, very useful stat... But what kind of sample do you need to not fall into these traps? Let's say that we're talking about a margin of error with fold to 3-bet of say 5%... You need at least 95% [confidence level] because these are stats that you just look at non-stop multiple times per player if you're using these. So number of hands you need for the 5% margin of error: 35,000 hands. And you're still going to fall into the trap of looking at too many numbers. So again, very, very tough to use these stats.

## The Solution: Player Profiling with Archetypes

> We want to be good exploitative players and to do that, we need information, right? We talked in the introductory video about our opponent overfolding. How do I know that my opponent overfolds?
> 
> What are we actually going to do with these tools? The answer I came up with is that we use these tools to profile players. So rather than looking for specific numbers, we actually want to look at all the numbers together and we use the numbers to form a player profile. So for example, someone who is over-folding, I would look for a bunch of numbers that all indicate overfolding. Generally someone who overfolds in one situation overfolds across the board.
> 
> What I'm looking for is kind of across the board, putting several statistics together. In this way, rather than having damage by looking at 20 numbers, I actually use the numbers to reinforce each other... I'm looking for a coherent picture of an individual, I'm actually willing to brush aside numbers that don't fit, and once I understand the player archetype, I can actually guess at numbers that I don't have the sample size and don't have the information on.

## Conclusion: A Better Way to Use HUDs

> The correct way, in my eyes, and the way that we're going to study in this course is we're going to talk about various different player archetypes, how to recognize those and once you recognize a player archetype you're already going to know which adjustments and how you want to play against that player archetype...
> 
> Anyone who doesn't use HUDs, this should kind of tell you that you don't need to. Most of the guys that are using HUDs against you that haven't watched this course are just using them really badly... you don't need to be afraid of HUD users. They're just doing it badly. Over time my HUD has actually gotten smaller and smaller for cash games... most people are using HUDs badly, you don't need to be worried about it.
> 
> But since you're with me in this course, I am going to show you how to use it in a way where you actually don't need to look at tons of numbers and you're using it in a more holistic way to profile players... It's going to be very simple, very effective, and very fun. And win you guys more money.
