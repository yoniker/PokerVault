Okay everyone, in this chapter we're going to talk about one of the issues with GTO. Part of the reason I'm going through this is that a lot of the process of turning you into an exploitative machine is going to be realizing that GTO in 6max no limit hold'em or 9max no limit hold'em, you know, it's not as good as people make it out to be. So here on the screen we have NL200 RAIC



Speaker

00:30 - 00:57

And we have UTG opening 2.5x. You guys can see there are a bunch of mixed hands here, right? Like 5s is raising some small amount of the time, 6-5 suited small amount of the time, KTL small amount of the time, etc. Now, why are there even mixes in preflop ranges? Let's start out by talking about that. Why not raise everything pure?



Speaker

00:57 - 01:27

Because kind of old school poker, before we had these computers, people would say: "Well, you know, K7 is just better than K6 and K5. Let's just raise K7 and dump K6 and K5. Similarly, you know, 10-9 is better than 9-8, 7-8, 7-6, like this doesn't make sense. Let's make a range that looks like this. I'm gonna make this range. I'm gonna take all the

S

Speaker

01:29 - 01:55

in between stuff, we're going to dump that and say this range, so similar amount of combos, but why do I need this small percent of this small percent of that? Let's have the good stuff, right? Why not have the good stuff? And here again, to understand what's going on, you need to take a step back and think about how do solvers actually work.

S

Speaker

01:56 - 02:21

You need to remember that solvers start out with the assumption that every player knows the other player's strategy and gets to adjust to it. And what happens when your opponent knows that you never have deuces is that on boards with a deuce, he's going to play differently. Now this isn't very significant, but it's significant enough that maybe you want to have a tiny amount of deuces

S

Speaker

02:22 - 02:47

If you have every combo, you'd rather not have them. If you never have them, you want a few combos. It's kind of like a joker. So the first few times you have deuces is actually better than sixes or sevens, because you have these a lot more often. Your opponent's playing around them more. Again, this is how solvers work. Now, if we go into the real world, nobody knows your preflop range.

S

Speaker

02:48 - 03:14

Obviously nobody knows your preflop range, and even if they did know your preflop range, would they actually play different if there is a deuce or there isn't a deuce? Like how confident can they be about what's going on? How accurate are their games? Now, if you ask me, I think this is bullshit. I think you need to play the range I just made here. I think this is going to win you more money, plain and simple.

S

Speaker

03:15 - 03:42

You know, 6s is better than 5s, 5s is better than 4s, no one's debating that. You're not playing against an omnipotent computer who knows everything that you're doing. So maybe there are some levels of poker where this is significant, but I don't think so. I think you need to play this range. But this is the GTO range. Why not just play GTO? We're going to talk about that a lot in this course, but this is maybe the first example.

S

Speaker

03:43 - 04:00

But this is not actually what I was meaning to talk about. We're talking about issues with GTO and multiplayer games. We're talking about why there are mixes. Hopefully now you guys understand a bit why. And of course, every hand that's mixed, opening and folding,

S

Speaker

04:00 - 04:28

By definition, the EV of opening is going to be 0 and the EV of folding is going to be 0. Because if the EV was positive, we're not stupid. We're going to raise the hand always, right? Like EV of 7s is winning money or EV of 9s is winning money. You never open fold 9s. So there are some mixes here. And when we open, say it's folded to the big blind, big blind also has some mixes defending.

S

Speaker

04:28 - 04:58

So some 4-deuce, some 5-deuce, some Q-10, some Q-J. Again, same theory. The hands are 0 EV. If you had too many of them, they would become minus EV. If you had none of them, they would become plus EV. So you settle at this kind of equilibrium. Okay, so what's the issue with GTO and multiplayer games? Sure, you know, there's something going on here with people reading each other's minds that's not very realistic.

S

Speaker

04:58 - 05:28

I'd rather have QJ and not have Q10 and J10 because it's just a better hand, it's going to win me more money. You could say that, I wouldn't disagree with you, but that goes deeper than that. So, let's say that we look at the big blind 0 EV hands. QJ, not making and not losing money. K10 the same, Q10 the same, J10 the same, etc. Let's actually throw this range into Equilab and

S

Speaker

05:28 - 05:57

rather than the mixes, we're going to assume that we always play all the mixes because, you know, we're here to play poker. We don't want to be a nit. We want to develop a better image. We think we're better than our opponents. A million reasons you can come up with. Okay, so every mix is in there. And here, you know, rather than calling 20%, we're calling 31%.

S

Speaker

05:57 - 06:14

Huge, huge difference. And if our opponent, the UTG player, is playing GTO, he's not making any adjustments to his strategy. The very base of GTO is that you don't make adjustments to your strategy. Now,

S

Speaker

06:14 - 06:35

All of these hands are 0 EV for us to defend. But what happens to UTG's EV when we defend a 0 EV hand? Now I want you guys to pause the video and think about this question. UTG and big blind. Big blind has a 0 EV defend. If he over defends, what happens to UTG's EV?

S

Speaker

06:41 - 07:09

If this were the GTO that we imagined, that we dreamed about when we were taught about GTO, the answer would be "nothing changes because GTO is the perfect way to play". You're just indifferent to all of your opponent's decisions. He can make mistakes, but he can't hurt you. But the thing is, this is not a two-player game. Even this UTG and big blind situation. There is a third player here, and that is the poker side who's taking Rake. Now,

S

Speaker

07:09 - 07:30

If the poker side is taking rake out of the pot and big blind ZV is 0, that means UTG ZV is negative. That means that every single hand that we defended in addition hurt UTG ZV. So UTG ZV is getting lower and lower and lower and lower.

S

Speaker

07:31 - 07:47

And all of these mixed hands, deuces, threes, four, five, five, six, five, sixes, king, seven, they're not zero EV anymore. They are now plain and simple losing money. They're minus EV opens. He shouldn't be making them. Now,

S

Speaker

07:48 - 08:10

This goes against the concept of GTO, because GTO, the entire idea is that you're supposed to be indifferent to all of your opponent's actions. You know, I don't care what he does, I play this, I'm all good, there's nothing you can do about it. But here we can see, you know, our opponent doesn't even need to do anything special, he just needs to be a bit loose, and then this range is no good.

S

Speaker

08:11 - 08:31

It's not that you can exploit and gain EV. We're not even talking about that. Of course, if someone's loose, you can exploit and gain EV. But we're saying you just lose EV. You're just losing, and it's not a small amount of money. Again, depending on the stakes, I think NL200 raked somewhere around 10 BB per 100.

S

Speaker

08:31 - 08:58

And that's hands that see the flop. So once you've already raised, we're talking more. So some of these opens could be losing quite a lot of money. I don't know, 1 BB per 100, 2 BB per 100. They could be losing you real amounts of money as your opponent defends more than more. I might be exaggerating the math, but that's definitely losing you money. Now, it could get more extreme. You know how some people in cash games, especially in live cash games,

S

Speaker

08:58 - 09:15

They have this philosophy of "I'm gonna defend my button. Nobody's stealing my button, nobody's stealing my straddle. I'm gonna defend it." If you have someone like that at the table, you could of course play good exploitative poker if you know what you're doing and you know how to adjust to a strategy like that. But let's say you don't.

S

Speaker

09:16 - 09:43

Can you play GTO and would it still work? And the answer is not really. Not really. If he's doing it correctly. And a good example of that is UTG opens. You can see UTG plus one has a bunch of hands that he 3-bets mixed. And he reaches a 7.8% 3-bet range. But were he to 3-bet all these mixes like so...

S

Speaker

09:44 - 10:15

Ace, 3, ace, 4, ace, 5, king, 5, king, 6. Throw all of these hands in there. Were he to 3-bet all these hands, we'd get up to a 13% 3-bet range. A lot, lot, lot more than 8% a lot of our opens would become -cv. Same reason as before with a ray. But we can make it even more extreme. If you look at the button's range, button gets to 3-bet wider. He gets to go with ace, jack, and king, jack.

S

Speaker

10:15 - 10:42

and probably some more suited connectors. I'm already making all the frequencies 100-bit. You guys can see suddenly Jack-10 and Queen-10 and Queen-Jack are in there. So we're making the frequencies higher and higher. Now, why does Button get to 3-bit UTG wider than UTG+1? The answer here is actually a fairly important one to understand.

S

Speaker

10:43 - 11:05

When UTG plus one 3-bets versus UTG, there are 4 players behind with uncapped ranges who are going to cold 4-bet him. At the bare minimum, we're talking about Queens plus Ace-King 2.5% per player, 4 players, so roughly 10% of the time you're getting cold 4-bets.

S

Speaker

11:05 - 11:24

And that really hurts the EV for you to 4-bet to 3-bet bluff. Really hurts your EV. So you can't go as wide. You have to be tighter. And as you get to later and later position, you get to be looser and looser because there are less people behind you. But if we think about where the money goes...

S

Speaker

11:26 - 11:43

You know, say I open UTG and UTG+1 is just a loose 3-better. That's good for these guys who are cold 4-betting him, but that's not necessarily good for me. That might actually just be plain bad for me. If he makes these loose 3-bets that ignore the fact that he's getting cold 4-bett,

S

Speaker

11:44 - 12:05

then the cold 4-betting guys win EV, but that doesn't help me, I'm just getting 3-bet by a range that's actually appropriate versus my specific range. So I am, in a word, getting kind of screwed. So I think we've seen a few examples, and a lot of what I'm trying to do here is help you guys

S

Speaker

12:05 - 12:27

to be a bit less attached to GTO. So we're seeing a few preflop examples of where sticking to GTO charts. They're a good baseline. It's important to understand what's going on. And you can learn a lot by studying them. You can learn a ton. But just go and copy-paste on GTO charts...

S

Speaker

12:27 - 12:41

you're not only leaving exploitative money at the table, you're just playing, you know, very often in a way that's not very good, right? Like, equilibriums work with two players,

S

Speaker

12:41 - 13:04

Once you add in the third rake player and then you add in all the multiplayer stuff that's going on, it's not what you call a stable equilibrium. Like people can screw you with no harm to themselves or very little harm to themselves. There's lots of really interesting stuff going on here. But yeah, that's basically the idea I want to get across here.

S

Speaker

13:04 - 13:27

this does go for some post-flop situations it goes for mtt icm situations but yeah pre-flop gto is a myth there is no gto pre-flop it's like an invisible agreement like if everyone agrees to follow these charts then these charts are the best way to play but if they don't

S

Speaker

13:27 - 13:56

It's not like your EV stays the same, like in theoretical GTO. Your EV might very well just be playing lower and you're just playing in a suboptimal way. And there's nothing special about these charts. You know, just because they're at an equilibrium doesn't give them any special powers to defend you, right? Like you need to look at reality, look at your opponents and learn good exploitative pre-flop poker, which we're going to do soon.
