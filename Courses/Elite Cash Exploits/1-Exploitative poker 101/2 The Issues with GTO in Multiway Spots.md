### My summary:

GTO actually loses money preflop if for example BB decides to defend wider (rake). So while I can learn principles from GTO, it's never to be followed blindly!

## Introduction: Questioning GTO in Multi-Handed Games

> Okay everyone, in this chapter we're going to talk about one of the issues with GTO. Part of the reason I'm going through this is that a lot of the process of turning you into an exploitative machine is going to be realizing that GTO in 6max no limit hold'em or 9max no limit hold'em, you know, it's not as good as people make it out to be.

## Why Do GTO Preflop Ranges Have "Mixes"?

> Why are there even mixes in preflop ranges? Let's start out by talking about that. Why not raise everything pure? Because kind of old school poker, before we had these computers, people would say: "Well, you know, K7 is just better than K6 and K5. Let's just raise K7 and dump K6 and K5... why do I need this small percent of this small percent of that? Let's have the good stuff, right? Why not have the good stuff?
> 
> And here again, to understand what's going on, you need to take a step back and think about how do solvers actually work. You need to remember that solvers start out with the assumption that every player knows the other player's strategy and gets to adjust to it. And what happens when your opponent knows that you never have deuces is that on boards with a deuce, he's going to play differently. Now this isn't very significant, but it's significant enough that maybe you want to have a tiny amount of deuces.

### GTO Theory vs. Real World Application

> Now, if we go into the real world, nobody knows your preflop range. Obviously nobody knows your preflop range, and even if they did know your preflop range, would they actually play different if there is a deuce or there isn't a deuce? Like how confident can they be about what's going on? How accurate are their games? Now, if you ask me, I think this is bullshit. I think you need to play the range I just made here. I think this is going to win you more money, plain and simple.

## The Core Issue: GTO vs. Rake

> By definition, the EV of opening is going to be 0 and the EV of folding is going to be 0. Because if the EV was positive, we're not stupid. We're going to raise the hand always, right? ... So there are some mixes here. And when we open, say it's folded to the big blind, big blind also has some mixes defending... Again, same theory. The hands are 0 EV. If you had too many of them, they would become minus EV. If you had none of them, they would become plus EV.
> 
> Okay, so what's the issue with GTO and multiplayer games? ... let's say that we look at the big blind 0 EV hands... Let's actually throw this range into Equilab and rather than the mixes, we're going to assume that we always play all the mixes... huge, huge difference. And if our opponent, the UTG player, is playing GTO, he's not making any adjustments to his strategy. The very base of GTO is that you don't make adjustments to your strategy.
> 
> Now, all of these hands are 0 EV for us to defend. But what happens to UTG's EV when we defend a 0 EV hand? Now I want you guys to pause the video and think about this question. UTG and big blind. Big blind has a 0 EV defend. If he over defends, what happens to UTG's EV?
> 
> ...the answer would be "nothing changes because GTO is the perfect way to play"... But the thing is, this is not a two-player game. Even this UTG and big blind situation. There is a third player here, and that is the poker side who's taking Rake. Now, if the poker side is taking rake out of the pot and big blind ZV is 0, that means UTG ZV is negative. That means that every single hand that we defended in addition hurt UTG ZV. So UTG ZV is getting lower and lower and lower and lower. And all of these mixed hands... they're not zero EV anymore. They are now plain and simple losing money. They're minus EV opens. He shouldn't be making them.

## GTO Is Not Unexploitable in Multiplayer Pots

> This goes against the concept of GTO, because GTO, the entire idea is that you're supposed to be indifferent to all of your opponent's actions... But here we can see, you know, our opponent doesn't even need to do anything special, he just needs to be a bit loose, and then this range is no good.
> 
> It's not that you can exploit and gain EV. We're not even talking about that. Of course, if someone's loose, you can exploit and gain EV. But we're saying you just lose EV. You're just losing, and it's not a small amount of money.

### Another Example: Loose 3-Bettors

> Now, why does Button get to 3-bit UTG wider than UTG+1? The answer here is actually a fairly important one to understand. When UTG plus one 3-bets versus UTG, there are 4 players behind with uncapped ranges who are going to cold 4-bet him... And that really hurts the EV for you... So you can't go as wide. You have to be tighter...
> 
> You know, say I open UTG and UTG+1 is just a loose 3-better. That's good for these guys who are cold 4-betting him, but that's not necessarily good for me. That might actually just be plain bad for me... So I am, in a word, getting kind of screwed.

## Conclusion: Preflop GTO is a Myth

> I think we've seen a few examples, and a lot of what I'm trying to do here is help you guys to be a bit less attached to GTO. So we're seeing a few preflop examples of where sticking to GTO charts. They're a good baseline. It's important to understand what's going on... But just go and copy-paste on GTO charts... you're not only leaving exploitative money at the table, you're just playing, you know, very often in a way that's not very good, right? Like, equilibriums work with two players.
> 
> Once you add in the third rake player and then you add in all the multiplayer stuff that's going on, it's not what you call a stable equilibrium. Like people can screw you with no harm to themselves or very little harm to themselves.
> 
> ...pre-flop gto is a myth there is no gto pre-flop it's like an invisible agreement like if everyone agrees to follow these charts then these charts are the best way to play but if they don't It's not like your EV stays the same, like in theoretical GTO. Your EV might very well just be playing lower and you're just playing in a suboptimal way. And there's nothing special about these charts... you need to look at reality, look at your opponents and learn good exploitative pre-flop poker, which we're going to do soon.
