Uri played a lot with his excel sheet in a way that I didn't quite understand.
What he did show is, that the profitable opening range on BU quickly changes if one of the blinds is playing too tight. For example, if SB plays a bit too tight, then instead of opening 40% of hands BU can open 60% of hands. The idea is that, GTO is very sensitive to small changes. In some spots GTO is very stable, but in others, like this one, small changes in how the other players behave result in big changes in GTO (what's optimal vs those players). 
If the BB is 3-betting me wide (20% 3-bet instead of 13% 3-bet) then GTO is to play a SUPER TIGHT range from BU, and basically never open a hand which folds to the 3-bet(!), so suddenly I open 20% of hands from BU(!).
