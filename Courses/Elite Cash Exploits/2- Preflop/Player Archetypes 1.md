# Poker History and Player Archetypes - Exploiting Loose Passive Players

## Core Concepts

### The Evolution of Player Types

"So we're going to start talking about poker history and player archetypes. Uh, now, as I mentioned previously, it's very important in order to exploit, to understand what players you're playing against and build exploitative game plans against specific player types rather than a specific statistic, because things, these things often go together, and a really good way to understand what player types are out there is to kind of take a journey through poker history and see how the game developed over the years, uh, what different styles there were and how these evolved."

"Very often what you'll see is something that's a bit similar to the solver in terms of strategy and counter strategy, but also similar to the solver in terms of, you know, at some point people learned about blockers, and at some point people learned about different sizings and how people actually used sizings to exploit leaks."

### The Loose Passive Archetype

"One of poker is a very, very specific player type. When everyone just learns the rules, everyone plays the same way. They play loose, passive, right? So they limp a lot. They call a lot irrelevant of size or position. They three bet too small when they three bet. If they even three bet, they also slow play a lot. So you have this kind of loose passive player type."

"Still a player you see fairly often, though not nearly as prevalent as they used to be. There are more of these in live environments or closed markets. Uh, then there are on the more competitive sites. But everywhere you're going to see these people, generally they are a bit new to poker."

"Understanding the preflop, loose passive guy is probably new to poker. Helps you to understand how to play post-flop against them."

### Exploitation Options Against Loose Passive Players

"If you're playing against, uh, a player or an environment of players who are playing this very loose, passive style, uh, high vpip, uh, you know, relatively low three bet, but but mostly just high Vpip, uh, how would how would you adjust? How would you exploit this, this very weak environment that's making huge mistakes."

"Option number one I'll play GTO ranges because GTO rules and I'm a GTO nerd. Hopefully I've convinced you guys this this is very, very wrong. It doesn't work. And in this loose passive environment, your GTO strategy, uh, might actually be underperforming compared to a normal environment."

"So let's talk about some other options so we can, uh, open bigger. We can limp, uh, we can open tighter and we can open looser."

### Why Consider Opening Tighter

"Why do I say open tighter. Because is six five suited good in this environment. You know you're always seeing a flop. Multiple players they're calling nine five suited. Is that good for you. Like six five suited is a type of hand uh that does pretty well against tight ranges. And as the ranges get looser and looser, it actually becomes, uh, relatively speaking, not not as good as a bunch of other hands. So maybe we'd want to open looser, maybe cut out some suited connectors."

### The Case for Limping

"Limping is really frowned upon in a professional environment. I think one of the first things that people teach you when you're learning to play poker well is to stop limping, cut out, limping. Limping is bad. Uh, now, in an absolute sense, yes. If if you're learning to play and you're limping, you shouldn't limp. Uh, but as you get to be a more advanced player, maybe this is a scenario where you should limp."

"Say you have fours under the gun, you want to play fours, but you can't steal the blinds. So what's the point in raising or 2.25? Like, what are you actually accomplishing, uh, bloating the pot with a hand that doesn't want to bloat the pot and doesn't have. Is not pushing any equity. You just want to see a cheap flop, maybe limp."

### The Solver Experiment

"We're going to use a pre-flop GTO solver. I'm going to show how, for those of you who don't care about solvers, you can skip ahead a bit, but I think I'll do it fast. It's still going to be interesting. So this is a tree I made. Heads up tree because I want lots of options and I want it to run fast. And I'm just looking for principles."

"I gave the first player three options. He can open two and a half x, which is a GTO at some size. He can open four x, which is terrible heads up or he can limp, which is at this rake structure, something that's never done."

"Difference number one is when we raise, our opponent cannot fold and this is meant to simulate the loose opponent. I also made it that when they three bet, when they four bet, they have bad sizes. So if you raise to 40 gets to three, bet to one, 20 raised to 25 and three bets to 80, you limp. He raises to 30. Everything's too small."

### Solver Results

"Results of the SIM, you never 2.5 x and you either limp or forex. Now forex of course maybe you'd want to go bigger. Uh, but at some point people start folding more. Uh, but but this is the GTO response, right? Is someone who's too loose. You do limp and you raise forex and you don't raise normal."

"To all the online players who are suddenly going to a live game and oh, everyone's limping and going forex and why? Let's just min raise go limping in forex. Is this probably the strategy? You know, it's probably superior to what you're doing and give some respect to people who grew up in this environment."

"The limping ranges are a bit protected. That's not necessarily something you're going to do. Depends how often you get isolated. All the shittiest hands are going to be in there. Uh, so the bottom of your range is always limping. The top of the range is mostly raising, but but mixing and everything else can kind of mix."

## Hand Examples

### Jerry Wu - Opening Big with AJ ($510 NLHE, 400bb deep)

"There was a crazy player, uh, playing on Chico Network a few years ago, uh, rumored to be Ben Affleck. As far as I know, I have no clue if there's any truth in that. His nickname was Jerry Wu, very extreme player."

"Simon raises I have ace Jack and I have this loose passive guy, very extreme arch type behind me. I guess he must always three bet or something. So I call he min raises call call. This guy goes 500, I go 3000 and Jerry calls here."

- **Preflop:** Uri has AdJs, makes it $3,000 (starting with $4,000 total), Jerry Wu calls with Jd6d, Tiger Mindset has K5
- **Flop (8d 4d 6c):** All-in commitments occur
- **Turn (5d):** Jerry makes his flush
- **River (As):** Uri makes a pair of aces but loses to the flush

"Obviously we're both pot committed. We get it in and you guys can see the ranges. Tiger mindset who's a regular player has King five. Uh Jerry who has Jack six suited I have ace jack off. So of course Jack six suited wins. But the example of opening big."

### Limp-Three-Bet with KK

"So I limp under the gun. There is obviously a big recreational. We get raise to 100, we three bet the guy shoves and we stack ace King."

- **Preflop:** Uri limps UTG with KsKd, gets raised to $100, Uri three-bets, opponent shoves, Uri calls
- **Flop (Kc Ah 2s):** Set of kings for Uri
- **Turn (Jd):** Board remains safe
- **River (9h):** Uri wins with set

### Limp-Three-Bet with JJ and the ISO Dynamic

"An interesting thing is right against a loose, passive guy. Often by limping they will ISO you fairly wide because they're looking to gamble. Even if it's a small ISO and you get a limp three bet. Whereas had I opened, he would just call, right? Like the he iso's a lot more often than he three bets. So I get to limp three bet big."

- **Preflop:** Uri limps with JhJs, gets isolated, Uri three-bets big
- **Flop (Ks Jc 6d):** Uri flops middle set, checks
- **Turn (Qs):** Check, bet small from opponent, opponent folds
- **River (2h):** Not reached

"Flop set. So we go check all check check. Bet. Smalley. False. Obviously had nothing, but, uh, we are pushing a really big preflop edge, uh, with this, with this action here."

### Limp-Squeeze with AK

"Look at this beautiful situation for ace. King. You'd never get this had you raised with a loose, passive recreational in a small blind. Had you raised even like a decent chance? The guy after me would slow play everything to keep the recreational. And then I'm just seeing a flop four way with Ace King off in a small pot. Now look at this beautiful situation. I get the limp squeeze big pick up $500."

### Multiple Limp Examples

"We limp under the gun. Limp, limp, limp. Look at this big blind ISOs. 12 x, of course. You sure? No one ever has anything. But he's very, very wrong. And pick up a lot of that money here."

"We get to limp. Four bet lots of that money again, very often had I raised the recreational would call this guy would three bet smaller and we'd be in a very different situation here."

### Limp-Three-Bet Bluff with T6

"Here. Looks like I decided to limp three better bluff. Uh, interesting to see how this one turns out. From a hand reading perspective. The interesting thing is, once I limp, three bet I kind of look like aces, right? Like, that's an assumption a lot of people make. Um, so playing ten six is tricky when you flop a pair."

"It's not a normal range situation. No one knows what's going on, so I just make a small C bet, get called turn two pair, which is nice. Um, here, I think I just have to go for it. Surprised to see the check. Looks like I checked. I'll get called. And are we getting cooler by Queens or cooler in Kings? Ah, okay. So we got ace Queen to stack off in bad shape."

## Key Takeaways

### The Strategy Summary

"So, uh, we have the strategy. We have hopefully the proof, and we can proceed with poker history now that we know how to dominate preflop against a specific archetype, which is, uh, you either open big or you limp, you don't open small because opening small is not, you know, the situation."

### Mixed Environments

"Now, of course, here I have kind of a mixed environment. It's not everyone at the table is loose, passive. Uh, so I'll make these kind of adjustments when the guy is very loose and kind of the entire table dynamic shifts around him to the point where everyone is playing differently."

### Why Limping Premiums Works

"You guys can see how I like limping premiums, uh, because people can't help themselves with isolate. This includes recreational players. Uh, and you often get especially nine handed this situation where rather than opening and getting a bunch of calls, you get to squeeze the table, uh, whether you do it with 4 or 5 or Ace or Kings, they all work nice."

### Range Construction

"It's not always premiums, right? Like, I don't know why this database doesn't have any of the suited connector stuff. Um, but yeah, limping premiums is nice. I just want to play a wide range."

"You guys can see 510 there. I do do it with. No, not that often in this temple, I have to admit. But there's queen three and suited connectors in there and jack seven suited in there like that. There's some funky stuff and this is just one, one database. I have a bunch of others."

### Final Thoughts

"So player archetype number one. I think we're done with that. Uh, and I'll see you guys in the next chapter."
