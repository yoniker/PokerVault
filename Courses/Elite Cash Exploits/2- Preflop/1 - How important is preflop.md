My summary:
Solver prefers a hand like QJo over 88 with a bigger preflop sizing because, in theory we won't see the flop as much and QJo has 'blockers' to villians continue range

Bigger sizings mean tighter, earlier positions also means tighter, when studying what range to defend it's interesting to compare, what range I should defend as BB vs BU 3x vs for example UTG 2.25x (it's actually a very similar continue range, although BB does 3B more).
against tight ranges, 54s is better than 98s because of two reasons:
1. UTG high cards range block my outs (on JTX for example)
2. When I do make a straight it's dominated a lot by his opening range

In this course in general we're going to talk not about specific exploits but HOW TO BUILD expolits. So far example, I could open BU 3x if I believe that people will still defend more loose, and be tighter.

Uri recommends to simplify my preflop open strategy to a simplified pure strategy (much like the one in pokercoaching) with the same percentage overall

# Exploitative Preflop Play - Coaching Transcript

## Introduction and Philosophy

### The Interconnected Nature of Exploitative Play


"Hey guys and welcome to the preflop chapter of the course. There's a big dilemma when teaching exploitative play because everything is very interconnected. In a way, even though I'm going to teach you guys not to play GTO and how to beat different player archetypes, I think it is important to start out by studying GTO."

"This is what a lot of other players are doing and it has its uses and there are things you can learn from it even though it's widely misapplied but GTO is a big big subject so what I'm gonna do in this chapter is kind of iterate we'll start out looking at some preflop GTO preflop charts we'll talk about them and principles and stuff like that we'll move to player archetypes we'll move to exploiting math examples hand examples and then go back and go deeper and deeper into preflop as we go on and on."

### The Importance of Preflop

"Poker players have a tendency to focus on what I like to call sexy decisions, where you really want to know what to do on the river when someone check raises you and you have two pair or some spot with a crazy bluff or whatever. And preflop is a lot less interesting and we have to face facts that even though we want to win money at the game, a lot of us are here because we enjoy it and preflop isn't the most enjoyable part of the game."

"But the thing about preflop is that it has a compounding effect - you play preflop every single hand, every single table over and over and over again. So even a small edge in a preflop spot will actually add up to be very, very significant to your win rate."

"If we're talking about defending the big blind versus an open or opening from cutoff when there are three players behind who know something about that's going to come up all the time. So very, very important, very important to your win rate."

## Core Concepts

### The GTO Preflop Myth

"Should you play GTO like the charts? There is something about having GTO preflop charts that's very calming. It makes you feel really good because the thought about GTO is that no matter what your opponent does, your strategy is good."

"So I want to kind of drive the point home of how untrue this is. And then we'll ask the question, should you even bother trying to imitate these charts ever? And how often are they actually applicable?"

### Why GTO Fails in Multiplayer Games

"When we look at this opening range, this opening range is good if everyone plays GTO, and it's the best range. And we already talked about how if the big blind were to call more 0 EV hands, we would actually start losing money very quickly for our entire strategy."

"Let's say the button cold calls more hands. This would also just be bad for us. And, you know, it might be good for the rake and it might be good for the people behind him who get to squeeze. But if he calls wider, that just costs us money."

"You're playing in a game where people love calling every pocket pair. This is not a rare game. I think a lot of games people are gonna not fold a pocket pair preflop when you open small under the gun. And if this is the case, this GTO range, it's not that you could exploit the guys, it's just not a good range for this game."

"While GTO has its perks, it's actually very inappropriate for multiplayer preflop games. And I'm kind of stressing this point because so many people have this tendency to just fall back on GTO for preflop and not actually play preflop."

"Unless everyone else plays GTO, you shouldn't play GTO preflop. And I know this is controversial to hear, but it's just the way it works. It's just the way the math works and the strategy is built. It's built to be at an equilibrium. Multiplayer equilibriums are not stable so you can lose EV along with another player or on your own and even though you're playing the GTO strat and that's just the way it is and that means that you really need to keep your eyes open and actually play poker preflop and stop being lazy about it."

### Where GTO Preflop Actually Applies

"Now where does GTO preflop actually apply at least a little bit? It's with defense ranges. So when UTG opens this range, you're in the big blind. You can't defend more hands than this, right? You could defend a bit less like the mixes. You can do whatever you want, but you can't defend more profitably."

"Of course, this assumes Villain's opening range is a very specific opening range, which is also something to talk about... the reality of even high stakes games almost always is that there is a recreational player at the table."

"Imagine this situation where the big blind is some loose, strong whale who's playing tons of hands. UTG shouldn't open 18.5%. He should open some other range. And you don't really know what range he's going to open, but certainly as the other players, you don't want to react anything close to this."

### Hand Categories and Opening Principles

"So first of all, we have premiums. Now premiums to me are boring. I don't want to talk about premiums because premiums are going to be in every range everywhere. I want to talk about everything else. So we have pocket pairs. We have suited Aces and Kings. So this is like a disconnected high-low card hand with a suit. We have suited Connectors and Gappers and 2 Gappers. And we have offsuit Broadways. And then we have offsuit Aces and Kings and Queens. And we have off-suit connectors."

"The reason I'm talking about these hand groups as hand categories is that how you want to play them is going to shift based on your open size."

### Size and Rake Effects on Hand Selection

"Whether you change opening sizes or rake structures, which is interesting, why do these have the same effect? The solver starts preferring, we'll call them suited kings and offsuit broadways over suited connectors and pocket pairs."

"Generally, the bigger you open, the less often you're going to see a flop. And the offsuit broadways and suited kings have something really big in common. It's very different from a hand like four or five suited or deuces. And that's that they have high cards. And having high cards in your hand is like a preflop blocker."

"When I have a king, you're less likely to have KQ suited, AK, PKK, all the kind of top of range hands. And as the rake structure either gets higher or my open size gets bigger, my opponent's range is getting tighter, so this effect is actually more significant in terms of how many folds it gets to generate."

"When you open a big size, big blind's folding 83%. When you min-raise, big blind is folding 56% so you're gonna see a flop maybe two and a half times as often and the playability is a lot lot more important than the high card removal effects."

### Defending Principles and Set Mining

"There's this concept in poker called set mining. You call to hit a set. And as the open size gets smaller, you get to set mine with various hand types, like you call to hit something nice with 10-4 suited. That's how small a min raise is."

"Why would 5 deuce suited be here but not ace-7 off or king-9 off? Obviously ace-7 and king-9 are in an absolute sense much better hands than 5 deuce suited but not when you're set mining against a tight range. King-9 off is not gonna hit a, you know, a gin flop. It's more often going to be dominated, it's not going to realize its equity very well. 5 deuce suited, it's actually doing a lot better."

### The Reverse Suited Connector Effect

"If you look at the suited connectors, you can see 4-5 and 6-5 and 6-7 are actually in here more often than 9-8 or 7-8. And there's more 10-8 suited than Jack-9 suited."

"When you look at UTG opening range for this small size, you see 9s and 10s and jacks and queens and queen-jacks suited and queen-tens suited. And what these hands mean is the higher your suited connectors are, the more often not only will the pairs get a bit dominated, like you both make a jack, because maybe you make a jack and he makes tens or nines, so that's not the end of the world. But the worst thing is your straights get dominated."

"When you have Jack-9 suited, the other guy has pocket kings, pocket queens, pocket tens. He's blocking all your outs, even ace-king, ace-queen, king-queen. So these high card straight hands are actually worse than the low card straight hands at set mining against a tight range."

### Positional Adjustments and Size Correlations

"As the size gets bigger and bigger, you can just make it as though the position got a tighter and tighter position in terms of how you respond. So for example, say button opens 3x, that might be the same response as versus an MP opening 2.25x."

"Button 3x you defend the same range as against the UTG 2.25x which is pretty amazing... think that someone's opening the button 3x and you defend as though he'd opened under the gun."

"Did he open the cutoff big? Oh, that's like opening UTG small. Did he open the button small? That's like maybe opening heads up."

### Building Exploitative Strategies

"The exploitative strategy is based on the assumption, which you guys could test. There are a variety of ways to test this. Most involve some kind of database analysis, but you could also just do it with intuition or with asking your friends. The assumption would be people don't realize how tight you need to defend versus a button 3x open or generally versus large opens from any position, and so they will just defend too loose."

"If we're just assuming people are just going to be way too loose, the natural way to exploit that would be to open 3x, but open tighter than these charts. How tight you could do calculations or you could wing it and then you would actually just be exploiting people preflop in multiple ways like you would put them out of their comfort zone completely they'd have no clue how to 3-bet how to defend."

"The third benefit is you kind of disguise yourself as a more recreational seeming player since 3x opens are usually a sign that you're not a professional because it's not the GTO open."

### Simplifying Ranges for Practical Play

"I'm a big believer in simplifying preflop ranges. And you have to remember when you see these mixes, like a bit of deuces, a bit of 6-5 suited, you have to remember the reason. And the reason is that at this weird GTO equilibrium that never happens in the real world, every opponent knows every other opponent's strategy."

"In the real world, no one's applying the extra pressure, and nobody is aware of your strategy. So you can never open 6-5 suited. And if you're playing a GTO-minded opponent, he will act as though you are opening at 10%, like how is he ever gonna know? So he'll just play his normal GTO style."

"When you're opening small from under the gun you're playing against loose ranges you know some hands are better than others. 6s is better than deuces. You know king-7 is better than king-6. It's not necessarily better than king-5. King-5 is a special hand. Try to think of why, we'll get to it soon. Queen-jack's better than queen-10. You know, obviously queen-jack is better than queen-10. Don't think that needs explaining."

## Key Takeaways

### On Studying GTO

"Should you play GTO like the charts? No, no, you shouldn't. You very rarely should. There are going to be some specific situations where you should, but we still need to study the charts."

"Number one reason is most professional poker players, I think, don't think the way I do about this. So they are just copy pasting the charts when they're playing. And you know, being an exploitative player is tougher than being a GTO player. The GTO player copy-pastes and the exploitative player needs to actually understand what's going on and what he's doing."

### Practical Application

"You can learn principles like how to respond to different sizings, how to respond to wider or narrower ranges, which hands are better than which other hands generally, and we'll think about why, and we'll look at strategies and counter strategies."

"As exploitative players, we always have to ask why things are happening, because only by understanding why can we use the knowledge and not just copy-paste the knowledge."

### Simplified Range Construction

"This range, I think it's just straight up a little bit better than the other range in practice, plus it's easier to remember."

"In terms of memory, it's easier not to have K8 and to have 4, 3, and 6, 3, and I think the ranges would do fine. They're fairly equivalent."

"Again you have hijack opening every offsuit broadway, which is nice... I think it's easier to go every suited King than to remember to cut one of them out. It's not very important."

"I think much much easier to remember than the GTO range, and no real benefit to the GTO range as we've seen. Either way, we're going to learn to adjust from these ranges. But if you want a default in a completely unknown field, I would go with these."
