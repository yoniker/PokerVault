S

Speaker

00:00 - 00:28

Hey guys and welcome to the preflop chapter of the course. There's a big dilemma when teaching exploitative play because everything is very interconnected. In a way, even though I'm going to teach you guys not to play GTO and how to beat different player archetypes, I think it is important to start out by studying GTO. This is what a lot of other players are doing and it has its uses and there are things you can learn from it even though it's widely

S

Speaker

00:28 - 00:54

misapplied but GTO is a big big subject so what I'm gonna do in this chapter is kind of iterate we'll start out looking at some preflop GTO preflop charts we'll talk about them and principles and stuff like that we'll move to player archetypes we'll move to exploiting math examples hand examples and then go back and go deeper and deeper into preflop as we go on and on

S

Speaker

00:54 - 01:16

So that's kind of the structure of the chapter. But yeah, before we start, I want to talk about how important is preflop and why preflop is actually important. Poker players have a tendency to focus on what I like to call sexy decisions, where you really want to know what

S

Speaker

01:16 - 01:43

what to do on the river when someone check raises you and you have two pair or some spot with a crazy bluff or whatever. And preflop is a lot less interesting and we have to face facts that even though we want to win money at the game, a lot of us are here because we enjoy it and preflop isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. But the thing about preflop is that it has a compounding effect

S

Speaker

01:44 - 01:58

you play preflop every single hand, every single table over and over and over again. So even a small edge in a preflop spot will actually add up to be very, very significant to your win rate.

S

Speaker

01:58 - 02:26

And there are actually fairly big edges in preflop spots that will come up over and over and over. If you guys watched the previous chapter of the course, you know how if we're talking about 3-betting big blind versus button, that's not going to come up very often. But if we're talking about defending the big blind versus an open or opening from cutoff when there are three players behind who know something about that's going to come up all the time.

S

Speaker

02:26 - 02:42

So very, very important, very important to your win rate. And I recommend even if this isn't the most sexy and interesting subject, I'll do my best to make it as interesting as I can. Focus and take notes because this is really, really important.

S

Speaker

02:42 - 03:00

Okay, so, should you play GTO like the charts? There is something about having GTO preflop charts that's very calming. It makes you feel really good because the thought about GTO is that no matter what your opponent does, your strategy is good.

S

Speaker

03:00 - 03:26

And that means he can't do anything to hurt you. Any, you know, bluff he adds, you're kind of at this equilibrium where it doesn't help him. If he calls too much or calls too little, none of these things help your opponent. So I want to kind of drive the point home of how untrue this is. And then we'll ask the question, should you even bother trying to imitate these charts ever? And how often are they actually applicable?

S

Speaker

03:27 - 03:54

So this is NL200ra, QTG raises 2.25x, and you can see that QTG+1 is 3-betting with K5 suited and K8 suited. So first of all, for those of you again who saw this in the previous chapter and might have been, "That's a really strange hand choice," I want to say that this specific sim has not actually been run

S

Speaker

03:55 - 04:22

to the utmost high accuracy, so it has got some leftovers in it. But, as you guys are about to learn, this is not a bad thing, because the way solvers work is they iterate max exploiting strategies. So when you see a leftover, like K5 suited 3-betting a fairly decent amount, and we know of course that in a finished sim K5 suited would never 3-bet,

S

Speaker

04:22 - 04:43

there is still some strategy that is being exploited by having K5 suited in the 3-bet range. And you would never know this and never know to think about this unless you looked at an unfinished sim and gave thought to the things that you see in it. So this K5 suited is actually something that we're going to talk about.

S

Speaker

04:43 - 05:05

And we're not going to use these sims to estimate accurate preflop ranges. We have other more accurate sims for that, but we are going to use them for some other things. And the inaccuracies are generally in the 3-bet and 4-bet ranges a lot more than they are in the opening and the defense ranges, which is what we're going to focus on right now. Here we have a UTG raise.

S

Speaker

05:06 - 05:29

And we have MP3 betting. And there is a kind of simplistic equation. This is kind of an old school equation. I want to walk you guys through the logic behind it because it's important to understand. And you guys have to remember, not only were solvers not always around, but we also want to understand the logic of what's going on.

S

Speaker

05:29 - 05:55

So when we're thinking about opening a hand, of course, we're always going to want to open aces. And the question is always, where do we draw the line in terms of hands? And the equation that I use to describe this is that, you know, when you open a hand, you lose your open size. But like whenever you manage to steal a blinds, you win the blinds plus your open size back.

S

Speaker

05:55 - 06:01

and whenever you manage to see a flop, there is some equity realisation that happens with the pot size.

S

Speaker

06:01 - 06:29

But whenever you get 3-bet you lose and most of the money comes from stealing because these are hands at the bottom of your range, they're not pushing much equity. In simple non-math terms, when you open you win some money when you steal the blinds, you win some money when you see a flop and then you win some of the pot and the rest of the time you're losing your open because we fold the bottom of our opening range to a 3-bet.

S

Speaker

06:29 - 06:58

When we look at this opening range, this opening range is good if everyone plays GTO, and it's the best range. And we already talked about how if the big blind were to call more 0 EV hands, we would actually start losing money very quickly for our entire strategy. So our aces would win more, our king-5 suited or king-6 suited would win less.

S

Speaker

06:59 - 07:26

Overall, we would lose money. So this would be bad for us and it wouldn't hurt anyone else. It wouldn't hurt the big blind. Next kind of things that could happen are, for example, let's say the button cold calls more hands. This would also just be bad for us. And, you know, it might be good for the rake and it might be good for the people behind him who get to squeeze. But if he calls wider, that just costs us money. And the same goes for every position. So, for example, you guys can see

S

Speaker

07:26 - 07:54

Button gets to call deuces, and UTG plus one has to fold deuces. Calling deuces would cost him money. But if UTG plus one is calling deuces, that's bad for him, and it's bad for the opener, and it's good for everyone else, and it's good for the casino's taking rate. So there are a bunch of changes that can happen. For example, you're playing in a game where people love calling every pocket pair.

S

Speaker

07:54 - 08:17

This is not a rare game. I think a lot of games people are gonna not fold a pocket pair preflop when you open small under the gun. And if this is the case, this GTO range, it's not that you could exploit the guys, it's just not a good range for this game. It's winning less than it would at equilibrium. You know, it begs the question:

S

Speaker

08:17 - 08:40

Should you even play this range? What's special about it? Because the special thing about GTO is that GTO defends you, right? You don't need to get into the leveling game. But we're seeing that when it's a multiplayer preflop game, this is actually just completely false because I just described a very simple situation. You open UTG,

S

Speaker

08:40 - 09:01

We see the button gets to call suited connectors and pocket pairs and suited aces in a way that makes you lose money. Because whenever he's breaking even or winning with a call, that means that you're losing because there is rake involved. Plus, you know, other people behind him could potentially squeeze him out of the pot. So even worse for you.

S

Speaker

09:01 - 09:29

So we're seeing that just this simple game where all the guys at the table call every pocket pair, call every suited connector and call every suited ace, which is like the most standard low stakes game ever or live game ever. This range is just very bad. It's just a bad range for the game. So while GTO has its perks, it's actually very inappropriate for multiplayer preflop games. And I'm kind of stressing this point because so many people

S

Speaker

09:30 - 09:56

have this tendency to just fall back on GTO for preflop and not actually play preflop. You're like, you know, when you're playing poker, preflop is solved and you're playing every other street. But I hope I'm managing to convince you guys this is just false. And while there are a lot of things that we can learn by studying GTO, it's really just like, you know, some kind of

S

Speaker

09:56 - 10:20

A rare animal in a zoo that's really nice to look at and zoologists like to study, but if you're in the real world, it has no bearing on reality. And, you know, unless everyone else plays GTO, you shouldn't play GTO preflop. And I know this is controversial to hear, but it's just the way it works. It's just the way the math works and the strategy is built. It's built to be at an equilibrium.

S

Speaker

10:20 - 10:48

multiplayer equilibriums are not stable so you can lose EV along with another player or on your own and even though you're playing the GTO strat and that's just the way it is and that means that you really need to keep your eyes open and actually play poker preflop and stop being lazy about it. Now where does GTO preflop actually apply at least a little bit? It's with defense ranges.

S

Speaker

10:49 - 11:10

So when UTG opens this range, you're in the big blind. You can't defend more hands than this, right? You could defend a bit less like the mixes. You can do whatever you want, but you can't defend more profitably. So this is one type of thing that you can learn from GTO.

S

Speaker

11:11 - 11:30

Of course, this assumes Villain's opening range is a very specific opening range, which is also something to talk about. And we'll get to that in a second, but actually maybe even talk about it now, because the reality of even high stakes games almost always is that there is a recreational player at the table.

S

Speaker

11:31 - 11:43

Now imagine this situation where the big blind is some loose, strong quail who's playing tons of hands. UTG shouldn't open 18.5%. He should open some other range.

S

Speaker

11:44 - 12:10

And you don't really know what range he's going to open, but certainly as the other players, you don't want to react anything close to this. And you're doing a lot more winging it. Like you're guessing what range he has and you're guessing the response you should make to that. And he's guessing his response. So this is actually the way preflop works, even with solver solutions, because this is not heads up poker, but it's multiplayer poker.

S

Speaker

12:10 - 12:18

It's a complete wild west. People are guessing at a lot of things. So let's say

S

Speaker

12:18 - 12:42

I open UTG, I'm not going to open this range, but how wide should I open? How big should I open? Actually, this entire simulation goes out of the window in a lot of those terms the second there are players who are playing very far from the GTO model, and there almost always are. And then it's going to go into this tree of response and counter response and tons of things that you really need to be aware of.

S

Speaker

12:42 - 12:53

Because like we said, there's nothing EV maximizing about the GTO strategy. It's just some nice looking strategy that might someday be at an equilibrium with five others.

S

Speaker

12:54 - 13:23

but in reality never is. Like I said, I'm stressing it because it's controversial. Please, if you're not convinced, go over this part again. Feel free to ask me any questions, challenge my opinion. I know it's not something that you hear very often. And this isn't like a Charlie Carroll screw GTO kind of thing. This is based on the way GTO is constructed and how it interacts with multiplayer games. Like this is very, very scientific approach.

S

Speaker

13:24 - 13:50

Okay, so should you play GTO like the charts? No, no, you shouldn't. You very rarely should. There are going to be some specific situations where you should, but we still need to study the charts. We need to study the charts for a bunch of reasons. Number one reason is most professional poker players, I think, don't think the way I do about this. So they are just copy pasting the charts when they're playing.

S

Speaker

13:50 - 14:17

And you know, being an exploitative player is tougher than being a GTO player. The GTO player copy-pastes and the exploitative player needs to actually understand what's going on and what he's doing. Just what we're learning here slowly, right? Because you could just take the charts and copy them, but once you understand how they're built, you realize that that's not really the way to go about things. Second thing is there are actually a lot of important principles that you can learn. So even though

S

Speaker

14:17 - 14:34

We're not going to copy-paste these charts, and we're actually going to use these preflop tools in completely different ways that you guys haven't even imagined. You can learn principles like how to respond to different sizings, how to respond to wider or narrower ranges,

S

Speaker

14:34 - 14:59

which hands are better than which other hands generally, and we'll think about why, and we'll look at strategies and counter strategies. So there is a lot to go into. So we're going to start, like I said, this chapter is not really about the GTO pre-flop charts, but it also is about the GTO pre-flop charts. We're going to kind of iterate and spiral and go deeper and deeper into understanding what's actually going on here.

S

Speaker

15:00 - 15:26

Okay, so NL200 rake and here we have a lot of different open sizes. Let's look at the UTG opening range. Well, we'll actually divide it into a few moving parts. So first of all, we have premiums. Now premiums to me are boring. I don't want to talk about premiums because premiums are going to be in every range everywhere. I want to talk about everything else. So we have pocket pairs.

S

Speaker

15:27 - 15:52

We have suited Aces and Kings. So this is like a disconnected high-low card hand with a suit. We have suited Connectors and Gappers and 2 Gappers. And we have offsuit Broadways. And then we have offsuit Aces and Kings and Queens. And we have

S

Speaker

15:53 - 16:08

off-suit connectors. Now I'm structuring it this way because these are actually the hand types in poker. If we look at the button opening range rather than a UTG opening range, you will see all the hand types here. Premium's on the top,

S

Speaker

16:08 - 16:29

pocket pairs, suited Aces of course are almost always there, but here we see suited Kings, suited Queens, suited Jacks. We have suited connectors, suited gappers, suited maybe two gappers a bit, and we have offsuit Aces, offsuit Kings, and we're stopping. The reason I'm talking about these hand groups as hand categories is that

S

Speaker

16:29 - 16:47

How you want to play them is going to shift based on your open size. And you might ask me, you know, who cares? I only play the GTO open size. GTO open size for Waltz It's Worth is 2.25x open from every position except the button. And button you open 2.5x.

S

Speaker

16:48 - 17:07

If you're copying an equilibrium, these are the highest EV sizings. But we're not going to be copying an equilibrium. And we're actually going to learn when we want to open different sizings and how to react to different sizings. This is a bit like I spoke about chess openings.

S

Speaker

17:07 - 17:29

If you just study the GTO sizing, you're missing out on a lot of stuff you could do that would take advantage of your opponent's mistakes, put them in tough spots, and you're also not really going to know how to adjust when someone else does something different. So what changes between ranges with, for example, UTG 2x open, this range,

S

Speaker

17:30 - 17:58

and UTG 3.5x open, which would be this range. Now obviously none of these are GTO sizings, but still what happens to the hands, which hands disappear and in what order. And what we see is that for the bigger sizing, the low pocket pairs are disappearing, right? Deuces, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens, even eights is getting folded. But ace, ten off, king, jack off,

S

Speaker

17:59 - 18:29

A bit of queen-jack off is there, king-5 suited is there. And this can be a bit misleading. Whenever we see low leftovers in a non-finished sim, we're going to ignore those. So this is a bit strange because between you and me, ace is just a better hand than ace-10 or queen-jack by a significant margin, by any normal human metric. But still, Solver likes these hands with bigger sizings more.

S

Speaker

18:29 - 18:59

And it also likes these hands more with lower rake structures. So here, we throw in an NL100 Sim. Like I said, we're going to be looking at plenty of different things. NL100 Sim with complete accurate ranges, so you don't have the suited kings there. But yeah, it has king-10 off, queen-jack off, even queen-10 off from UTG.

S

Speaker

18:59 - 19:27

compare this to an NL2000 rake sim. An NL2000 rake sim has these... you know, the opening range is the same. It has less K5, K6, K7. It has less K10, Q10, QJ and it has more low pocket pairs and suited connectors. So there's this thing that's going on. Whether you change opening sizes or rake structures,

S

Speaker

19:28 - 19:56

Which is interesting, why do these have the same effect? The solver starts preferring, we'll call them suited kings and offsuit broadways over suited connectors and pocket pairs. Now as humans we can only guess at the reason. You can't ask the solver why are you doing this. And you could run some experiments, but I think the reason is kind of clear. Generally, the bigger you open, the less often you're going to see a flop.

S

Speaker

19:56 - 20:16

And the offsuit broadways and suited kings have something really big in common. It's very different from a hand like four or five suited or deuces. And that's that they have high cards. And having high cards in your hand is like a preflop blocker. It's a preflop removal effect. When I have a king,

S

Speaker

20:16 - 20:39

you're less likely to have KQ suited, AK, PKK, all the kind of top of range hands. And as the rake structure either gets higher or my open size gets bigger, my opponent's range is getting tighter, so this effect is actually more significant in terms of how many folds it gets to generate.

S

Speaker

20:39 - 21:06

So it might generate maybe 1% extra of his range folds at one situation and maybe 3% in another one. So it's more significant. And also kind of the post-flop playability is less significant because you just see a flop less often. Like when you open a big size, big blind's folding 83%. When you min-raise, big blind is folding...

S

Speaker

21:07 - 21:36

56% so you're gonna see a flop maybe two and a half times as often and the playability is a lot lot more important than the high card removal effects and the same thing goes for rake structures if we go back to 2K NL versus the 100 NL sim right so same open size if you open at NL 100 big blind will see a flop 37.5% of the time

S

Speaker

21:36 - 21:42

If you open it, this is NL2000, 37.5.

S

Speaker

21:42 - 22:10

NL100, we're talking 28. So yeah, 25% more often that you see a flop at the high stakes than at low stakes. And this is going to make deuces more valuable, right? Because if we're not seeing a flop, deuces is the worst hand in the deck in terms of generating folds. You're taking two of the lowest cards out of the deck, you're going to get the minimum amount of preflopped folds. So it's a terrible hand. You see this in tournaments very often.

S

Speaker

22:11 - 22:39

But if you're going to see the flop every time, deuces is a really nice hand and maybe Q10 off or K5 suited are not as good. Let's look at all the ranges one after the other and we'll kind of see how they go when you get to later and later positions. So between UTG and UTG+1, we get more of the offsuit broadways and we start getting A9 off.

S

Speaker

22:39 - 22:51

We get all the suited Kings down to King five good question like where is King form? No, that's something to think about we'll talk about that as well we get

S

Speaker

22:51 - 23:18

you know, an extra suited queen, an extra suited jack, we get more of the suited connectors, but we're still not really touching on the suited gappers or low pocket pairs. It's interesting, and like I said, the reason has to do with the rake structure. As you guys switch rake structures, this is going to change. But the even deeper reason is not the rake structure, but it's how often you see a flop.

S

Speaker

23:19 - 23:45

And if you're playing in a game where you see the flop often, maybe you want to treat it as though it's a different rake structure, exploitatively speaking. So we move on to the cutoff. We see suddenly more suited queens, more suited queens. The broadways are filling up. We're getting some offsuit aces. We're still at this rake structure being careful with the suited connectors and pocket pairs.

S

Speaker

23:45 - 24:00

And when we get to the button, finally we start seeing 75 off-suit and we see some suited checks. But you guys can see how important just understanding these principles of rake structure are for opening ranges. And this is...

S

Speaker

24:01 - 24:26

You know, when I give you guys a chart, in the end, you go and you play your own rake structure, right? Each of us plays a different rake structure. So this is really important just to understand that as the rake gets higher, everyone should be... You know, all these things I just said, rake gets higher, people should play tighter. We stress hands in a different way. And again, comparing this to...

S

Speaker

24:26 - 24:50

this sim. We were saying before how the pocket pairs were almost never there and here you can see MP they're almost all there and you actually have less of the other hand types. You already see suited gappers getting in there from the cutoff from MP. Cutoff has you know 9-6 suited so very very different ranges right when people are seeing the flop more or

S

Speaker

24:50 - 25:14

or less, you value your hands very differently. So this is one thing we're learning from preflop. We have the hand groups, we see how they iterate between positions, you get looser or wider, and of course, like we said, if people are cold calling more and 3-betting more, etc., you obviously want to be tighter, we'll talk about that more in depth, but not right now.

S

Speaker

25:14 - 25:33

Let's look at the big blind defense range for a bit and we won't go to three betting ranges yet. We'll finish with big blind defense. We'll jump to some other subjects. So again, different types of opens. So UTG opens 2x.

S

Speaker

25:34 - 25:52

you can see how big blind is defending really really wide. 6-deuce, even 9-deuce suited a little bit but we're ignoring leftovers. So all of the hand type 7-8 off and the reason is basically plot offs. There's this

S

Speaker

25:52 - 26:19

concept in poker called set mining. You call to hit a set. And as the open size gets smaller, you get to set mine with various hand types, like you call to hit something nice with 10-4 suited. That's how small a min raise is. Go up to 2.25x, and this shifts quite dramatically. You guys can see this in the sim, where now it's up to the three gappers.

S

Speaker

26:20 - 26:50

and none of the really bullshitty hands and a lot less offsuit stuff and this really goes to show that we are actually set mining right like why would 5 do suited be here but not a7 off or king 9 off obviously a7 and king 9 are in an absolute sense much better hands than 5 do suited but not when you're set mining against a tight range king 9 off is not gonna hit a you know a jinn flop

S

Speaker

26:50 - 27:12

it's more often going to be dominated, it's not going to realize its equity very well. 5 do suit it, it's actually doing a lot better. So again, these are principles of how we're ranking hands. We're going to learn them as deep as we can because this will let us adapt to a wide variety of situations. By the way, this is why 2.25x is like the magic number size.

S

Speaker

27:13 - 27:38

Because there's this big group of junky hands that can set mine when you go 2x and they can't when you go a bit bigger. So 2.5x. What you see is how set mining starts becoming a bit iffier with the three gappers and the junky suited stuff and offsuit stuff. Even nice hands are starting to have trouble. And again, think how unintuitive it is to...

S

Speaker

27:38 - 28:07

You know, sometimes fold QJ and actually call 5-2 suited or 8-5 suited more or like that. The hands feel different, but you have to understand what it's like playing against a tight range. Now, what if UTG opens 3x? You get kind of even more exaggerated effect, right? Now, A-10 offsuit is folding, 5-3 suited still calling. And we're getting tighter and tighter. And 3.5x is the biggest I have in this set.

S

Speaker

28:08 - 28:16

Of course, as people open bigger, the assumption is also they're opening a bit tighter. And here we actually see Ace-Jack offsuit folding.

S

Speaker

28:16 - 28:40

We still defend mostly suited connectors, suited gappers and there is also this interesting effect. If you look at the suited connectors, you can see 4-5 and 6-5 and 6-7 are actually in here more often than 9-8 or 7-8. And there's more 10-8 suited than Jack-9 suited. So it's kind of a backwards world. I want you guys to pause the video and try to think about

S

Speaker

28:41 - 29:07

Why this might be? Again, as exploitative players, we always have to ask why things are happening, because only by understanding why can we use the knowledge and not just copy-paste the knowledge, right? So why is jack-9 suited folding but 10-8 suited calling? In what world are our hands ranked this way, and is this a kind of real effect or a fake effect that we would rather ignore?

S

Speaker

29:12 - 29:38

Hopefully you guys really paused, but this is actually a question I asked GooseCore, for those of you who know them years and years ago, in a completely different context, but the logic is still the same. And when you look at UTG opening range for this small size, you see 9s and 10s and jacks and queens and queen-jacks suited and queen-tens suited. And what these hands mean is the higher your suited connectors are,

S

Speaker

29:39 - 29:59

the more often not only will the pairs get a bit dominated, like you both make a jack, because maybe you make a jack and he makes tens or nines, so that's not the end of the world. But the worst thing is your straights get dominated. These are set mining hands, right? They want to make a straight or a flush.

S

Speaker

30:00 - 30:25

And when you have Jack-9 suited, the other guy has pocket kings, pocket queens, pocket tens. He's blocking all your outs, even ace-king, ace-queen, king-queen. So these high card straight hands are actually worse than the low card straight hands at set mining against a tight range. Now, this is a real thing. Once we understand that this is the way it works, we can say, is this actually true? Should I use this? And the answer is probably yes.

S

Speaker

30:25 - 30:52

We're actually going to see this principle at play in a bunch of different scenarios when ranges get really tight. You guys are going to see some crazy stuff like queen-jack suited is folding but four-five suited is calling. We're going to mention this again, so don't worry if you're not taking enough notes. Okay, so that's UTG. We're kind of skipping again. This is just to build intuition for you guys. So...

S

Speaker

30:54 - 31:18

What's going to happen with MP opening? So MP is a looser range. So it makes sense you would have the same kind of structural differences maybe as we would between different UTG sizes. So say UTG 2.5x and MP 2.5x, we're looking at how big blind would defend.

S

Speaker

31:18 - 31:49

presumably you would see the same effect as before where you see the same hand types but the range gets wider and wider. And then the question is would it get wider in the same way? Because you could compare UTG small to MP small and then we see all the different hand sizes. And the truth is yes, MP 2.25x looks a bit like UTG 2x. If you guys look at the left and right

S

Speaker

31:49 - 32:20

things here. These look kind of similar. They're not identical, but they're getting there. And what this is giving you guys is basically a principle for how to play when people open bigger. As the size gets bigger and bigger, you can just make it as though the position got a tighter and tighter position in terms of how you respond. So for example, say button opens 3x,

S

Speaker

32:21 - 32:49

that might be the same response as versus an MP opening 2.25x. Now let's check if that's actually true. I haven't checked this. And we'll see if this is a reasonable principle to use. So here we have button opening 3x. We see the big blind response. And here we're going to look at MP opening 2.25x.

S

Speaker

32:49 - 33:15

we're going to see the big blind response and it actually looks like the big blind response to the button 3x is significantly tighter and we're actually seeing different differences. I guess the the fold frequencies are similar. This would be like a maybe UTG

S

Speaker

33:16 - 33:40

yeah this would be like a u so so button 3x you defend the same range as against the utg 2.25x which is pretty amazing now you do defend it differently in the terms that you three bet more and call less but the hands are kind of similar and also the hands are ranked a bit different not really um so

S

Speaker

33:40 - 33:46

Kind of interesting to think about, right? Like as the size gets bigger you can also treat it as though

S

Speaker

33:46 - 34:10

the position gulped tighter and the difference between 2.25 and 3x might be the difference between UTG and button like this is amazing think that someone's opening the button 3x and you defend as though he'd opened under the gun now without looking at this you might never think about this and there are lots of recreationals who open 3x if we were to kind of think in a chess openings way of you know

S

Speaker

34:10 - 34:36

I want to play in a way that exploits my opponent's mistakes and I don't think they're going to be aware of this you might decide to actually open button 3x with the assumption people would call too much and 3 bet too little and in that sense you would actually open tighter than the GTO range and this is actually an example of a thought process of constructing an exploitative strategy

S

Speaker

34:37 - 35:04

So the exploitative strategy is based on the assumption, which you guys could test. There are a variety of ways to test this. Most involve some kind of database analysis, but you could also just do it with intuition or with asking your friends. The assumption would be people don't realize how tight you need to defend versus a button 3x open or generally versus large opens from any position, and so they will just defend too loose.

S

Speaker

35:04 - 35:21

Now to show this as an example here, you guys can see that when button raises 3x, big blind needs to fold hands as strong as a7 offsuit and fold 10-9 offsuit fairly often.

S

Speaker

35:21 - 35:34

And also, S3 bet quite a lot, but yeah, fold K9, a7, and this is, you know, people are used to when button opens, just to show the regular defense range.

S

Speaker

35:35 - 35:51

People are used to defending down to K6 and defend every offsuit ace, so folding a7 is like a big thing. If we're just assuming people are just going to be way too loose, the natural way to exploit that would be to open 3x, but open tighter than these charts.

S

Speaker

35:51 - 36:05

how tight you could do calculations or you could wing it and then you would actually just be exploiting people preflop in multiple ways like you would put them out of their comfort zone completely they'd have no clue how to 3-bet how to defend

S

Speaker

36:05 - 36:30

and then also probably be making a mistake in the direction you can estimate. And kind of the third benefit is you kind of disguise yourself as a more recreational seeming player since 3x opens are usually a sign that you're not a professional because it's not the GTO open. So this is just an example of building an exploit. I'm not necessarily recommending you guys do this and throughout the course

S

Speaker

36:30 - 36:52

I'm not going to give you guys exploits because when I give an exploit in a course, there is this issue where maybe a lot of people know about it and then it stops working because other people that you're playing with are aware of this exploit. But we're more talking about how to build the exploit. So you look at a different strategy, you see how people might react, and based on that,

S

Speaker

36:52 - 37:06

you adjust the strategy in one direction or another and that's where you get your edge. You could play the GTO open range, you'd still get an edge if people defend too much, but you can get extra edge by doing this as well.

S

Speaker

37:07 - 37:25

So this is how I would recommend you guys work with these charts. We're seeing how rake structures affect things, the defense ranges, how open sizes affect them and how positions affect them. And they're all kind of similar, which is pretty cool, I think, that you can kind of iterate

S

Speaker

37:26 - 37:55

Did he open the cutoff big? Oh, that's like opening UTG small. Did he open the buttons small? That's like maybe opening heads up. Next, before we move on to the next part of this chapter, there's another thing that I feel is important to talk about when you're using charts. I'm a big believer in simplifying preflop ranges. And you have to remember when you see these mixes, like a bit of deuces, a bit of 6-5 suited, you have to remember the reason.

S

Speaker

37:56 - 38:17

And the reason is that at this weird GTO equilibrium that never happens in the real world, every opponent knows every other opponent's strategy. So if you never have 6-5 suited, the other guys know you never have 6-5 suited, and that creates a situation where boards where 6-5 suited hits...

S

Speaker

38:17 - 38:46

you're gonna get paid off a lot, there's gonna be more pressure applied, and then you want a little bit of these to balance that out. In the real world, no one's applying the extra pressure, and nobody is aware of your strategy. So you can never open 6-5 suited. And if you're playing a GTO-minded opponent, he will act as though you are opening at 10%, like how is he ever gonna know? So he'll just play his normal GTO style.

S

Speaker

38:46 - 39:14

and if you're playing against a non-GTO opponent then guys trust me like we talked about how maybe 6-5 suited is better against tight ranges but when you're opening small from under the gun you're playing against loose ranges you know some hands are better than others 6s is better than deuces you know king 7 is better than king 6 it's not necessarily better than king 5 king 5 is a special hand

S

Speaker

39:15 - 39:42

Try to think of why, we'll get to it soon. Queen-jack's better than queen-10. You know, obviously queen-jack is better than queen-10. Don't think that needs explaining. So we'll open Equilab and I'll build some normal ranges for you guys. Alright, so you're opening... Let's actually do these based on the NL100 rake, which is more accurately solved.

S

Speaker

39:42 - 40:12

So, you want to open UTG 18.3% of hands. GTO approximation. We are going to go with Ace-3. We're going to go with King-8. And we're going to kind of round up, kind of squeeze hands together. This is going to mean that it's easier for you to play the strategy and the strategy is stronger against the average player.

S

Speaker

40:12 - 40:26

So, you know, just good things going on here. Okay, so this is the same range in terms of this is 18.4% in hands versus 18.3%.

S

Speaker

40:26 - 40:54

It is a lot easier to remember, and there's no randomizing involved, which saves you energy and saves you brain power as you're playing. Now, you could play around with this, like maybe you like 4s more than you like King-8 suited. No, King-8 suited has to be there. Maybe 4s more than 10-8 or more than Queen-Jack, but I think this is a good starting point. And let me quickly do this for the other ranges so you guys can screenshot it for people who are lazy to do it.

S

Speaker

40:54 - 41:23

Like I said, this should be a straight-up upgrade because either you play against a GTO player or it doesn't really matter, or you play against a non-GTO player and then 6s are better than 5s or better than 4s, etc. So this is UTG MPO opening range. We're going to have to do 23% in here and we're going to squeeze the deuces into the other hand categories. And...

S

Speaker

41:24 - 41:55

Let's quickly do this. Yeah, sure. There you go. So actually, in the interest of keeping it simple, I think we could actually do it like this. So again, you have roughly the same percent, much easier to remember range, right? No...

S

Speaker

41:56 - 42:18

30% Jack-10, 50% Queen-10. It's like, okay, hijack every Broadway. And then 4s+, but no biggie if you open Deuces and 3s, you have suited connectors, King-6+, or whatever. Like you guys are realizing, I don't respect the GTO ranges too much, so for me it's the same if you do this. There's no difference.

S

Speaker

42:19 - 42:42

This is actually easier to remember. So just in terms of brain space, I would say go with this range, go like one and a half percent wider. Again, no one's going to know. And if there are reasons to open to be looser or tighter, of course, we'll use those. But this would be the default for people looking to copy GTO. Next, we have cutoff. We're going to simplify the cutoff to...

S

Speaker

42:44 - 43:05

And like I said, we're trying to avoid the mixes and also keep things very very simple in terms of memorization. This is actually a fairly easy one. So this would be, cutoff would be like take the hijack,

S

Speaker

43:05 - 43:35

Add ace-9 offsuit, add down to like a few more queens and kings and go more suited connectors. Now... And actually, let's take all the suited gappers. So we're now adding connectors, gappers, queens, kings, and an extra broadway. So a lot more connectors, gappers. Of course, this is a 2k NL range, guys, in terms of break structure. That's why we have this order, where we take the NL 100 range.

S

Speaker

43:36 - 44:01

we would of course add hands in a very different order, right? Like we would go cut off and not add connectors, gappers, we'd add more offsuit stuff, but you guys should know this. So this is just an example of how to build a high stakes range in a way. If you guys want, I'll do an example for a low stakes range as well. Okay, so button for high stakes range would be 2.5x.

S

Speaker

44:01 - 44:28

And we're now going, look how easy it is. Every ace, king, queen. Let's go every jack as well. Keep things simple. Ace, four, king, eight. And there we go. And we'll go three gappers down to here. So again, more or less rough. I think, you know, if

S

Speaker

44:28 - 44:58

In terms of memory, it's easier not to have K8 and to have 4, 3, and 6, 3, and I think the ranges would do fine. They're fairly equivalent. And yeah, I'm adding Jack-Deuce and Jack-3 for ease of reference, so you don't have to remember those. And like I said, this range, I think it's just straight up a little bit better than the other range in practice, plus it's easier to remember. We have these ranges. Feel free to screenshot them, use them if you want. I'll do the same quickly for lower stakes.

S

Speaker

44:58 - 45:31

And then we will actually move on from the GT ranges to the next part. For those of you who find this boring, skip ahead. I'm really trying to do it as fast as possible. It's just when you don't do this, people are often lazy about doing this and end up copying the charts, which, like I said, is a shame to do. So we will go like this. So this could be...

S

Speaker

45:32 - 45:56

an example of a UTG opening range. It's a lot easier to remember than these mixes. Plus it's a lot more of the top-end hands. Again, to me, I would skip A9, A jack, 10 just because this is easier to remember.

S

Speaker

45:57 - 46:24

And the rest we're just building with the same principles of before, where we would rather have the high card hands than the low card hands. And that's it. So this would be the same range. It has more 4s, less 3s and deuces, the offsuit broadways are easier. Again you have hijack opening every offsuit broadway, which is nice.

S

Speaker

46:24 - 46:56

Cut off will quickly do and you guys see the specialized 5/0 that it's not the same as a special King 5/0 So cut off again, I think it's easier to go every suited King than to remember to cut one of them out It's not very important Okay And let's show I missed these hands Yeah, so this would be more or less cut off

S

Speaker

46:57 - 47:22

Again a lot more linear. No ace-5, king-9, jack-9, 10-7 is there but always all the kings are there. I think just much much less brainpower plus more effective. And last one is button. Button here will go ace-deuce, king-jack like before and then go like this with

S

Speaker

47:23 - 47:47

the gappers and stuff, we might as well go every ace if you guys feel like remembering to cut out the deuce then of course do that. And yeah, we have similar percent, again there is no reason to be exact here, we're always just playing with mixes more or less. I think much much easier to remember than the GTO range.

S

Speaker

47:48 - 48:06

and no real benefit to the GTO range as we've seen. Either way, we're going to learn to adjust from these ranges. But if you want a default in a completely unknown field, I would go with these. This wraps up the first part of the preflop section where we go over a bit of GTO opening ranges.

S

Speaker

48:07 - 48:19

in defense in as much depth as we can and as I said we're going to steer very far away from these but these are a bit of a baseline and important to know see you guys in the next chapter
