Let's go a bit through the history of 3-bet. People used to think that facing a 3-bet when you're OOP, you should 4-bet or fold, and there are no profitable calls because you will miss the flop most of the time and face a stronger range than yours OOP, so you're torching money. So people thought that there are no calls in that spot.

Since people overfolded to 3-bets, 3-bets were printing money. Either people call and then fold to my c-bet, or they fold preflop, and they don't 4-bet enough.

Current situation: Since people flat more than they should and 4-bet less than they should (at NL100 at least), then I want to have more linear range, hands that play well postflop, than the solver suggests. So for example as UTG+1 vs UTG, instead of mixing 3-bets with 55-99,and infrequently 3-bet 54s,65s,76s,some A9s,A8s and never 3-betting QTs,JTs, 3-bet only 99+, never 3-bet A7s/A8s, and 3-bet QJs,JTs

as BU, there are some hands like KQs AJs that prefer call over 3-bet, and that's because those hands really hate getting 4-bet (and are marginal call/fold vs a 4-bet).
What's marginal or not, depends on the position (for example BB vs BU open, the hands thaat hate getting 4-bet are different- KJs/QJs/ATs etc).

The BB 3-bets infrequently (in theory) som trashy blocker A-x offsiot, K-x offsuit, Qx offsuit, and can do this only when using a bigger 3-bet sizing. If I'm 3-betting to a smaller sizing then I see more flops, so those trashy hands are almost never 3-bet and instead I 3-bet more of the playable hands.

Suited connectors have a nice property that they have the same equity (more or less) vs a tigher range (the range that calls a 3-bet) vs a more wider range(the range that opened). Since those hands preserve their equity and gain some fold equity, that's what's nice about those hands to 3-bet them(although solver does it infrequently/sometimes even vs BU open).

Uri thinks about the 3-bet range like a machine with a few moving parts.
The main part (the engine) are the value hands, so for example, 99+,AJs+,AQo,KQs, and then the question is, what do i put in addition to that engine. 

Against someone who overfolds, we can add trashy blocker hands like A4o,K8o.

Against someone who is calling but not 4-betting I don't want any of the trashy stuff, we should add playable hands like suited broadways,pocket pairs,maybe J9s/T8s,A5s but that's it, the range is going to be super linear, I can add suited connectors (optional-I don't have to, those hands are doing ok postflop)
