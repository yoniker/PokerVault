Let's go a bit through the history of 3-bet. People used to think that facing a 3-bet when you're OOP, you should 4-bet or fold, and there are no profitable calls because you will miss the flop most of the time and face a stronger range than yours OOP, so you're torching money. So people thought that there are no calls in that spot.

Since people overfolded to 3-bets, 3-bets were printing money. Either people call and then fold to my c-bet, or they fold preflop, and they don't 4-bet enough.

Current situation: Since people flat more than they should and 4-bet less than they should (at NL100 at least), then I want to have more linear range, hands that play well postflop, than the solver suggests. So for example as UTG+1 vs UTG, instead of mixing 3-bets with 55-99,and infrequently 3-bet 54s,65s,76s,some A9s,A8s and never 3-betting QTs,JTs, 3-bet only 99+, never 3-bet A7s/A8s, and 3-bet QJs,JTs
