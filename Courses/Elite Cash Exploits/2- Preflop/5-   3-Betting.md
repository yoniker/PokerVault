Let's go a bit through the history of 3-bet. People used to think that facing a 3-bet when you're OOP, you should 4-bet or fold, and there are no profitable calls because you will miss the flop most of the time and face a stronger range than yours OOP, so you're torching money. So people thought that there are no calls in that spot.

Since people overfolded to 3-bets, 3-bets were printing money. Either people call and then fold to my c-bet, or they fold preflop, and they don't 4-bet enough.
