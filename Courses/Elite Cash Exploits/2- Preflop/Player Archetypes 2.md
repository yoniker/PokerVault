Another archtype is the TAG nit (those players dominated the poker world when it was passive-loose). Uri gave a BvB situation and asked, how wide can SB open?
If BB under 3-bets by a few percents and under-calls by just a few percents compared to GTO, SB can profitably open any two cards. On the other hands, against a guy who 3-bets more than GTO, we should open super tight.

We need to know the rough GTO baseline stats vs a sb open so we can compare it to the player's stats: BB should 3-bet 18% and call 40%,so the total continue range percents in GTO is about 60%. Just a small deviation like 45% call 13% 3-bet and i can already open close to 80% of my range profitably! and 40% call 13% 3-bet is already open ATC territory.

If it's a player I'm playing against all the time, I want to soft-exploit and not hard-exploit (not open ATC), and if I do hard-exploit and open 72o, make sure it doesnt go to showdown (fold if i have a marginal bluffcatcher, if it's a marginal bluff spot then bluff and bluff bigger so it won't go to show down, since there's a real cost to villian seeing those hard-exploiit deviation hands).
