Another archtype is the TAG nit (those players dominated the poker world when it was passive-loose). Uri gave a BvB situation and asked, how wide can SB open?
If BB under 3-bets by a few percents and under-calls by just a few percents compared to GTO, SB can profitably open any two cards. On the other hands, against a guy who 3-bets more than GTO, we should open super tight.

We need to know the rough GTO baseline stats vs a sb open so we can compare it to the player's stats: BB should 3-bet 18% and call 40%,so the total continue range percents in GTO is about 60%
