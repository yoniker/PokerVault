Okay, so in this chapter I'm going to talk about different ways in which you can structure exploitative strategies. And the titles I call this are hard exploiting versus soft exploiting. Now to explain the terms, hard exploiting is exploiting someone to the absolute maximum that you can. For example, if someone is over-folding in a spot, you will bluff every single combo

S

Speaker

00:30 - 01:03

even ones with tons of showdown value, whatever makes you money, you just do it. Soft exploit is more a kind of silent but deadly style. I guess a good example would be preflop. Let's pull up a preflop chart. Let's say that I'm opening the button. And you guys can see the button opening range here on the bottom right. And I know the big blind is overfolding to an extent where I can open any two cards profitably.

S

Speaker

01:03 - 01:31

A hard exploit would be to open everything. A soft exploit would be to open a bit wider than this, so all the mixes 100%, maybe add a bit more on top and leave it there. The idea of course is that hard exploit makes you more money, but it risks discovery a lot more. As long as you're kind of playing within the mixes, it's very tough for people to know what you're doing. But with a

S

Speaker

01:32 - 01:58

hard exploit. If I open 10-5 off and this goes to showdown in some way, I don't know if my opponent is going to adjust or not and maybe I've kind of burned my exploit. Like, am I going to feel comfortable opening too much anymore for a while? And how will I know if my opponent noticed and if he adjusted or if he didn't? So these are kind of the two different styles of exploiting and of course there is

S

Speaker

01:58 - 02:18

It's not black and white, you can do stuff in between. I want to give you guys a few examples and I want to start with a math example of the issues with hard exploiting. The example I want to talk about is kind of a toy game example. We're inventing a theoretical game.

S

Speaker

02:19 - 02:41

But we're making it close enough to poker where it's easy to understand what's going on. So in this spot, we're talking about a 4-bet, 5-bet spot. So let's say we're just playing these 4-bet, 5-bet spots. Now, I know that your 4-betting range overfolds to 5-bets by 4%.

S

Speaker

02:41 - 03:00

So every 5-bet bluff I make makes me $10. Now I'm throwing the numbers out there, don't worry about them. They could be different, but it's going to work the same. So every time I 5-bet bluff, I make $10. We play this spot 30 times and I always 5-bet, I win $10 of EV.

S

Speaker

03:00 - 03:15

every single time. But what happens to my EV if you catch on to what I'm doing and you know that I'm always 5-betting with all my bluffs? If you know, you would just stop 4-bet bluffing.

S

Speaker

03:15 - 03:43

You just stop completely. Once you realize what's going on, I've 5-bet you 30 times in a row. At some point, you realize you're like, this 4-bet bluffing isn't working too well. Let's put it on the side and try 4-betting this guy, this aggro maniac with hands that are actually going to call off. So the 31st time that you 4-bet me, you have a pure value range. We're always calling.

S

Speaker

03:43 - 04:12

And like always, I am always bluffing. And at this point, if it's a 5/10 game, and I 3-bet, say, $100, you 4-bet to $200, I shove another $900 in with whichever hand I have, I now lose $400. Now, why $400 if there are any math sticklers here? I'll show you guys.

S

Speaker

04:12 - 04:42

It's a rough example, but let's say that you have Queens plus Ace-King and I have some suited Ace or something. I have 30% equity. Pot's going to be, say, $2,000. I won $600 of those. My stack was $1,000. So maybe I'll lose $300 because I already had $100 invested. But either way, I'm just randomly putting numbers here to prove a point.

S

Speaker

04:43 - 05:13

So this is kind of the issue with hard exploiting is that when you're hard exploiting a small league, getting discovered is very very very risky. So for example, someone overfolds blind versus blind. This is very very common. It does get, and I will show you guys examples of where it gets to the point where you can open 7-deuce off. But if you opened and your opponent saw, what are you gonna do now?

S

Speaker

05:13 - 05:41

And how quickly can you lose money in some of these spots if you make these mistakes? Like the small edges that you're gaining add up, but they can disappear really, really, really fast. Generally, what you want to be doing when you're doing soft versus hard exploits is if it's a once-in-a-lifetime spot, go ahead and do the hard exploit if you're never going to play with a guy again, obviously. But any spot that repeats itself and guys that you're playing with over and over,

S

Speaker

05:42 - 05:54

You want to be very careful and try to sustain your edge. And this is my approach. I do have a friend whose approach was always to go for the max hard exploit.

S

Speaker

05:55 - 06:16

And he wouldn't care if people saw because he loved these leveling wars. He was like, okay, you're going to see that I five bet bluffed you with some random shitty hand. I know how you're going to adjust. I'm going to be one step ahead of you all the time. Now, this is a very legitimate approach. You need to be a lot more focused to pull it off.

S

Speaker

06:16 - 06:32

So my preference is, I guess, in a way, kind of more lazy. I want to exploit in a way where no one's ever going to know that anything's going on. And then I don't need to keep track and worry about stuff like you just have no clue that this is even happening.

S

Speaker

06:32 - 07:00

Okay, so I want to give you guys some examples regarding preflop ranges to kind of drive the point home. Let's say that you're in a big blind and you know button is folding too much to 3-bets. And the preflop section will make this more extreme. So you could 3-bet this. This would be the hard exploit, right? And presumably this would work great, but it's very easy to notice and I think way too extreme. Maybe a

S

Speaker

07:01 - 07:29

A nicer way of doing this would be to take... I'm just gonna put... This is not like the GTO 3-bet range, but say we'll take a 3-bet range that seems reasonable. Okay, so something like this. I want a 3-bet more, but not in an extreme way. So let's add 4-5 and 4-3. Let's add suited gappers.

S

Speaker

07:30 - 07:42

We'll add some more pocket pairs. We'll add a few of these, we'll add a few of these. And you would, depending on how extreme you take this,

S

Speaker

07:43 - 08:10

you could get to 26% rather than 15%, so you are exploiting your opponent quite a lot. But you're doing it in a soft way where none of the hands that you're showing now are extreme enough where they should make him pick up and take notice, and your frequency isn't extreme enough. Now, there is a step further you could take this, and again, we're going to talk about all of this a lot more in depth down the line. And a step further would be, well, you know, this guy is overfolding,

S

Speaker

08:09 - 08:20

So let's do less value. We'll cut out some of the good hands and just throw in extra bluffs, more of this stuff.

S

Speaker

08:21 - 08:41

or this stuff, maybe some gappers. Leave the percent similar but change the makeup. You could also do this. Yeah, just some examples. Again, it's a simple concept, hard exploiting versus soft exploiting. It's important to know it's going to come up a lot down the line. So I needed to put it out there and I think with that we can move forwards.
