Last study session 7-July

## Flop

Any pair is good enough to call the R30 bet by BU on the flop as BB, even A9o sometimes call.

Jx and Qx region is the region which x/r the flop (with or without a gutshot) the most (and 98s with backdoor) and does it infrequently. For value Kx x/r infrequently

## Turn

## River

Flop goes X/B30/C turn 8h X/X River Jd X/B50 - BB calls PURE any 8x and up (so any pair on the board)

Flop goes X/B30/C turn 9h X/X River 9c BB bluffs only small pocket pairs (22-88), frequency looks random to me for now (22-33 a lot,44-77 infrequently, 88 frequently)
