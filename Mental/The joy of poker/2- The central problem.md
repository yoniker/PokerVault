Jason claims that the help of professional psychologists and mental coaches isn't helpful. While they suggest to either inject logic while understanding the root of the problem /do stuff, it's not helping players to live a fullfilling, happy life. He claims that what needs to be done is to feel the emotions, that presence is a skill that needs to be worked on, I need a method to constantly work on it and improve it.
