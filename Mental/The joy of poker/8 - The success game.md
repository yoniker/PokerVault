MJ, 5 years after retiring, during a celebration putting him in the hall of fame, "thanked" all of his opponents, the coaches that didn't believe in him etc. He runs on toxic fuel - couldn't enjoy his success. He played the achievement game- the game that almost everyone plays.

On the other hand, passion, confidence, creativity clarity and growth are clean fuels.

To play the success game, I need to celebrate my achievements every time, even as something small as getting up from bed, finishing a Pomodoro, eating a healthy meal.
Do it in a present state: 
Use the 3D present state technique, then say out loud "I studied for a pomodoro right now. I did that.". Then, from the present state, acknowledge the sensations and thoughts that this brought. It's ok if the thought is "it's too small to celebrate". Accept the thought.

Celebrating all of my achievements from a present state will provide me an endless, constant well of clean fuel for growth. The more I'll do, the better I'll feel!
