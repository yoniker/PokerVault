Everyone can have a mental breakdown. People laugh at Matusow for having a breakdown every time when he's in a late stage in a tournament, people who can't reach those stages to begin with.

The anatomy of breakdowns go something like:
Stage 1- I'm focused Stage 2- Tournament go deeper, with more at stake, I remember the unresolved emotions from previous times when losing when a lot was on the line, stage 3- Something bad happens, and those unresolved emotions cause me to break down and play bad, Stage 4 - I "unwind" by scrolling endlessly at social media, eating junk food etc Stage 5- I try to rationalize my mistake with logic by consulting with other poker players - even though I was in a completely different state, emotionally, when the breakdown happened. The problem wasn't knowledge of the spot, but how I handled my emotions.

eg I should not ask "what happened logically" but "how did I feel when that happened?".

How do I deal with entering bad states in which I breakdown?

## Step 1-Map

Jason suggests to enter a present state using the 3D method, and then complete prompts like-
"When I feel X I do Y", "What Z happens I tend to feel Y which makes me do Q".

For example, "When I lose big, I feel tightness in my shoulders and I tend to be on my phone rather than paying attention"/"When I'm having the thought of needing to make the perfect decision, I will often do something I regret".

## Step 2-Plant the seed

For each of those insights from stage 1, talk about loud, different rhymes, tones and phrasing each time, stating the insight, so I will learn it,let myself hear the truth (talk out loud, don't just think it).

## Step 3- Interrupt

When I recognize in real time (it could be just when I "mourn" as per stage 4 of a breakdown), interrupt it, go into a present state using the 3D presence technique, and from there make a decision. Just interrupting this is a win-even if I still make a decision I regret, the wired behavior was interrupted, and now I can fix it!
