Poker players are told to not worry about the things that they can't control, like variance, and think only about the things they can control, like how much they study, how much volume they put etc.

That's a contradiction, because they are told not to think their throughts, and not to feel their own feelings. You have the thought of being sad for losing this huge pot to 2 outers? Be happy, you played well! Don't think about it! 

But we can't control our feelings, we can't not-think our thoughts, we can't not-desire that which we desire. So the "focus on what you can control" is a broken system-it tries to control exactly the things that we can't control (emotions, thoughts etc).


Instead of that, when I lose confidence, I need to celebrate by going through the "what's true exercise".

In a present state (using the 3D presence technique) answer the following questions:

1. The thoughts I'm having
2. The sensations I'm experiencing
3. Things I'm unsure of
4. Things I've already done on this front
5. Things that didn't go as hoped


Celebrating is always the next step forward, and the most productive step. Use it OFTEN!
