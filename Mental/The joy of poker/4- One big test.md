Everything that happens at the poker table is a test, as everything (winning,losing, breaking even, or even winning at the exact boring rate i predicted before playing) is a test and can trigger me. Failing a test, and I can easily erase a lot of my earnings.

There are 4 myths in poker:

1. The cause of dips in poker are emotions - it's not true, as emotions are neutral. If emotions were bad for playing, there would never be a top athlete who is a "clatch" player.  It's all how I experience the emotions.
2. There are positive and negative emotions: While anger,fear,sadness are painfull, it really depends on how I experience them. For example, some people love watching horror movies, cathartic crying is purifying etc
3. The logic problem: There a hidden assumption that the emotions are wrong. It's wrong to feel bad when I'm on a downswing as long as I'm playing well, it's wrong to celebrate a win if I put my money in bad etc. The emotions aren't wrong. "Stop feel how you feel" or "It's wrong to have those emotions"-are very bad pieces of advice. I need to be in a present state with my emotions and experience them as they come.
4. Paralysis by analysis: Friends of the author keep going to mental coaches, feeling there's progress, only to return to the same problems over and over. They're asking why they feel what they feel, but their answers is biased by emotions, and even if they knew somehow the cause, then it wouldn't magically solve their issues. We need to feel the emotions as they come in a present state.
