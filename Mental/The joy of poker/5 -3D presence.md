Presence needs to be precise, have speed,be reliable and be adaptable to the different scenarios poker throws at me.

The 3 dimentions of presence are what I feel physically (sensations), my thoughts and the outside worlds.

1. Sensations : Take deep breaths, and then ask: Where is it? What is it doing? It is what I feel-any bits of sensations of movement of energy that I notice is happening inside me.
2. Thoughts - are subjective, author suggests to preface them with "I have the thought that". I have the thought that I'm not good enough to play high stakes. I have the thought that this player comes after me. Both might not be true, and by framing the thought as "I have the thought that...", I connect to the absolute truth and give myself a chance to view things from a truth prespective. It's true that I have the thought. This is undeniably true.
3. Environment: Choose an object to focus on, and try to notice a new detail I didn't notice about it before. I can move closer or away, focus on a very specific point or have a very wide focus. Same thing for my other senses. Do I hear something I usually don't hear? How about smelling/touching sth new.


Try to practice those 3 in different order, then juggle 2 at a time, and then all 3.
Presence requires 100% accuracy and 100% acceptance. Don't resist my current experience!  Saying stuff like "no need to feel bad, i played great","If I can get even I'll feel better" or distract myself from feeling by using substances like food or drinks. Accept what I'm feeling, and feel it.
