Poker players think that it's simple to make money in poker, earnings are just edge time volume.
But then, when their downswing comes, they discover it's not that easy. They become frustrated by the pressure of performing, and when they go on downswings, them taking a break is costing them a lot. 

People want to find their A game by building routines and habits, but those don't result in A game. The only thing that is common to all A-game performances is - Presence. 
Presence should be my goal, not winning money, prove I'm smart, outplay my opponents etc.


The real door to poker success isn't a system, it's a relationship.
A healthy relationship between me and my emotions.
