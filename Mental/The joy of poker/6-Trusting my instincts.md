Poker players tell each other, or to themselves "trust your gut"- without a clue on how to do that.
Jason suggests this simple system:

1. Get into a present state using the 3D presence technique
2. Notice if there's any option in front of me that I'm drawn to.

The 4 keys to instinctive plays are:
1. Giving myself total permission to do what my instincts tell me
2. Allow myself to look dumb. I will either feel dumb when I don't listen to my instincts, or I will look dumb when I do listen to my instincts and I'm wrong. 
3. Sometimes I will be drawn to both options of, say, calling or folding. I need to acknowledge this when it happens,and not pretend that I do. Then, from a present state, after acknoledging that I'm drawn to both options, I give myself a chance of creating a new level of awareness, notice a small detail I didn't notice before. Sometimes I will make a decision without knowing - and that's ok. Accept it.
4. Prioritazation - I need to prioritize being in a present state before listening to my instincts. Otherwise, if I will listen to my instincts when I'm in a, un-present state, and give that total permission, this can become a weapon against me to lose my money as fast as possible.

I also need to stay in a present stay in the aftermath of making my decisions, so I won't get too high for being right or too low for being wrong,  and won't let what other players think affect my state.
