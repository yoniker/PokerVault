Not playing my A-game happens for predictable reasons.
The problem with common advice like "don't focus on the result" or "be fearless, play your best game" as a mental game strategy, is that it's just like saying in poker "win the hand" or "play a winning strategy". I need to develop a strategy

Don't assume I know the cause to why I don't play my A game. Start with what I know, and use the knowledge in the book to figure out why. Write down answers to questions about myself that appear in the book, and always take a step back and think if the strategy offered in the book works for me.

Go slowly through the book, it will take time to improve my mental game.
