# Learning More Efficiently - Jared Tendler Summary

## The Inchworm Concept

- Progress involves ups and downs
- Both A-game and C-game must improve for overall skill progression
- Learning is at the heart of mental game improvement
- Have to improve my C-game (left side of my bell curve of performances) in order to move forward (otherwise, when too many things not in my unconscious competence, I have too many things to think about during a hand )

## The Adult Learning Model - Four Stages

### Stage 1: Unconscious Incompetence

- Your blind spot - weaknesses you don't know exist
- You don't know what you don't know

### Stage 2: Conscious Incompetence

- You've identified an area of weakness through reflection, analysis, or education
- Common mistake: Assuming identifying the problem means knowing how to correct it
- Recognition is just the first step - work is still needed

### Stage 3: Conscious Competence

- You've made progress in correcting the weakness
- Varying levels within this stage - stronger competence = easier thinking
- If you revert back when tired/tilted, the skill is still at this level
- More work needed to reach true mastery

### Stage 4: Unconscious Competence

- Knowledge applied consistently, instantly, correctly, without thinking
- Works even under extreme circumstances
- The "holy grail" of learning
- All technical and mental work should aim here

## Driving Example

- **Unconscious Incompetence**: Child who doesn't know what driving involves
- **Conscious Incompetence**: Teenager aware they can't drive
- **Conscious Competence**: New driver thinking about every action
- **Unconscious Competence**: Experienced driver handling complex situations naturally

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Trying to Do Too Much at Once

- Top performance requires clear, focused, energized mind
- Learning multiple things simultaneously slows progress
- Consciousness (stages 2-3) takes up mental bandwidth
- Mental effort managing emotions/skills prevents focus on expertise

### 2. Getting Ahead of Yourself

- Prematurely thinking you've achieved mastery
- True mastery proven under intense pressure
- Skills should remain accessible after breaks

## Reaching Unconscious Competence

### Key Requirements

- Lots of repetition in variety of challenging situations
- No shortcut for consistent effort and time

### Ways to Speed Up the Process

1. **Organized warm-up and cool-down**
    - Prepare to be at high level to learn at high level
    - Reflect, review, analyze performance daily
2. **Work from different perspectives**
    - Hear concepts explained in different ways
    - Multiple examples and stories help firm grasp
3. **Strategic break management**
    - Before break: Write notes, consolidate what's in your mind
    - Provides roadmap for return
    - Allows clearing mind while away

## Key Takeaways

- Stages of learning are same for everyone
- How you move through them and speed is where you gain edge
- Unconscious Competence frees mental bandwidth for higher performance
- Not about autopilot - about having higher base of knowledge/skill to operate from
