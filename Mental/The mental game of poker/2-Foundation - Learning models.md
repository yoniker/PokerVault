# Chapter 2: Foundation - The 3 Learning Processes

## Overview

Chapter 2 presents three foundational theories that form an organized structure for improving your mental game. Understanding these processes helps eliminate mental game problems by clarifying how learning and performance actually work.

## 1. The Adult Learning Model (ALM)

The ALM defines four distinct levels of the learning process:

**Level 1 - Unconscious Incompetence**

- You don't know what you don't know
- You're blind to the ways you lack skill
- Example: A child who doesn't understand how to drive a car

**Level 2 - Conscious Incompetence**

- You become aware of what you don't know
- You recognize skills you need to improve
- Example: Realizing you're playing too many hands but not yet knowing proper hand selection

**Level 3 - Conscious Competence**

- You've gained skill through work and repetition
- You must think about what you've learned to perform correctly
- Without conscious thought, you revert to incompetence
- Example: Knowing proper starting hands but needing to think about each decision

**Level 4 - Unconscious Competence**

- Skills are automatic and require no thinking
- This is the "Holy Grail" of learning
- Your mind is free to learn new things
- Example: Instantly folding marginal hands without thought

Key insight: Both good habits AND flaws can exist at the Unconscious Competence level.

## 2. Inchworm

Shows how improvement happens over time through your performance range (visualized as a bell curve):

- **Your range**: The natural variance between your best (A-game) and worst (C-game) performance
- **Movement**: Like an inchworm, improvement happens from both ends:
    - Front end advances when you reach new peaks
    - Back end advances when you eliminate weaknesses
- **Key principles**:
    - Playing your best is a moving target
    - Eliminating weaknesses creates space for an even better A-game
    - Improvement requires working on both strengths and weaknesses
	When I play my C-game, I can clearly see what is not yet a part of my unconscious competence-from that standpoint, errors are a learning opportunity

**Common mistakes**:

1. **Ignoring weaknesses**: Learning only new things while avoiding weak areas creates an unsustainably wide range
2. **Comparing worst to best**: During tough stretches, compare your current worst to your previous worst to see improvement
3.  Trying to Do Too Much at Once

- Top performance requires clear, focused, energized mind
- Learning multiple things simultaneously slows progress
- Consciousness (stages 2-3) takes up mental bandwidth
- Mental effort managing emotions/skills prevents focus on expertise

4. Getting Ahead of Yourself

- Prematurely thinking you've achieved mastery
- True mastery proven under intense pressure

## 3. The Process Model

Organizes the recurring parts of poker performance into 5 stages:

1. **Preparation/Warm-up**: What you do before playing
2. **Performance**: Actually playing poker
3. **Results**: The outcome of your play
4. **Evaluation**: Reviewing results immediately after playing
5. **Analysis**: Actively working to improve away from the table

This creates a continuous improvement loop that applies to:

- Individual hands
- Single sessions
- Months/years of play
- Your entire career


### Performance advice
Don't analyze hands during a session. I can mark hands for later analysis, I can note how my opponents play so I can adjust, but focus on the game, not on analyzing pervious hands

## Key Takeaways

- Emotions aren't the problem - they highlight flaws in your mental approach
- Real improvement requires training skills to Unconscious Competence
- Progress happens by advancing both your best and eliminating your worst
- Consistent improvement requires daily use of the Process Model
- Understanding these processes prevents fighting against the reality of how learning works

The chapter emphasizes that these theories provide the foundation for solving mental game problems like tilt, fear, motivation issues, and confidence problems by understanding the true nature of learning and performance.
