## Why Warm-up and Cool-down Matter

- The greatest predictor of long-term success is learning and improving every day
- Structured warm-up and cool-down is one of the easiest ways to consistently play at a higher level
- Helps identify what to improve and track progress
- Makes skills at Conscious Competence level more likely to show up during play
- Provides necessary repetitions to reach Unconscious Competence

## Warm-up Routine

### Basic 3-Minute Warm-up

1. **Review what you're working on**
    - Remind yourself of specific technical improvements (e.g., value betting more, tightening opening range, 3-betting less)
    - Review your mental game improvement strategy
2. **Take a few deep breaths to focus and play**

### Additional Warm-up Strategies (up to ~15 minutes total)

- **Set session structure**: Decide how long you'll play
- **Remove distractions**: Phone, chat, TV, browsers, etc.
- **Review long-term goals**
- **Clear your mind**: Take notes on personal life concerns to address later
- **Review relevant materials**:
    - Hand histories that fit current improvement areas
    - Mental game notes or "mental hand histories"
    - Previously watched training videos (for reinforcement, not new learning)
- **Physical preparation**: Exercise or walk
- **Mental preparation**: Meditation, visualization, breathing exercises
- **Extended warm-up**: Play 30-50% of usual tables for 30 minutes to transition smoothly into full grinding

## Cool-down Routine

### Basic 3-Minute Cool-down

1. **Estimate variance**: Objectively assess how variance affected results
2. **Evaluate performance**:
    - How did you do in areas you're trying to improve?
    - Were you able to stop/spot tilt sooner?
    - Did you correct previous technical mistakes?

### Additional Cool-down Strategies

- **Review marked hands**: Mark non-standard hands during play for later review
    - Tough decisions
    - Potential mistakes
    - Tilt triggers
    - Creative plays
- **Document progress**:
    - Note new details about mental game problems
    - Record things you did well
    - Note regular players' tendencies
- **Mental release**: Write about what's weighing on your mind
- **Refine next session**: Update warm-up based on session findings
- Notes about session: Other than general notes, rate my quality of play, and rate the way I handled my emotions

## Key Principles

- Start with basic 3-minute versions if new to the concept
- Build up to more comprehensive routines as they become habit
- Warm-up ensures you start at a high level
- Cool-down helps you:
    - Put poker down and relax (like "icing muscles after a tough game")
    - Track progress objectively
    - Identify new learnings
    - Prepare for next session

The warm-up and cool-down create a feedback loop that accelerates skill development by ensuring you're consistently performing skills at Conscious Competence level, which leads to faster mastery at Unconscious Competence level.
