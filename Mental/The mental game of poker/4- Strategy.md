# Chapter 4: Strategy - Summary

## Overview

This chapter provides the two primary strategies for solving mental game problems:

1. **Injecting Logic** - Short-term containment strategy
2. **Resolution** - Long-term permanent solution

## Injecting Logic

### What It Is

- A strategy to control mental game problems while playing
- Builds mental muscle to fight emotions in real-time
- A temporary bridge to resolution, not a permanent cure
- Works by using thinking to combat emotional problems

### When It Works Best

1. **Before reaching emotional threshold** - Once emotions cross the threshold, the brain shuts down thinking ability
2. **When the logic also corrects the underlying flaw** - This makes progress toward both short-term control and long-term resolution

### The 6-Step Process

1. **Recognition** - Spot the signs of your mental game problem in real-time
    - Create a detailed profile of your patterns
    - Study it regularly
    - Set alarms if needed
    - Take action immediately when recognized
2. **Deep Breath** - Create separation between you and your emotion
    - Calm emotions if too high (tilt, anxiety)
    - Increase intensity if too low (motivation issues)
3. **Injecting Logic** - Use a prepared statement to keep your head straight
    - Write it down (don't rely on memory when emotional)
    - Make sure it corrects the underlying flaw
    - Use your own language
    - Examples: "Bad players have to win; it's just variance"
4. **Strategic Reminder** - Quick review of poker fundamentals
    - List what disappears from your game when emotional
    - OR list all factors in your decision-making process
    - Helps maintain control of technical game
5. **Repeat as Necessary** - The problem will keep coming back until resolved
    - Be prepared to go through steps 1-4 multiple times
6. **Quitting** - Know when to stop
    - Sometimes need to push through, sometimes need to quit
    - Build mental muscle gradually (like weight training)
    - Start with 5-10 extra minutes when struggling

## Resolution

### What It Is

- The permanent solution to mental game problems
- Trains corrections to Unconscious Competence level
- Eliminates the emotion connected to triggers
- Frees up mental space for focus and improvement

### Mental Hand History (5-Step Protocol)

1. **Describe the problem** - Write exactly what happens
    - Example: "I go on tilt when a fish sucks out on me"
2. **Why does it make logical sense?** - Find the logical reasons
    - Example: "I always expect to win against bad players"
3. **Why is that logic flawed?** - Identify the errors in thinking
    - Example: "I'm ignoring variance; I believe I control outcomes more than I do"
4. **What is the correct way to handle it?** - Define the solution
    - Use affirmative language
    - Example: "I can only control how well I play, not the cards"
5. **Why is that correction correct?** - Reinforce the rationale
    - Helps learning and adds clarity

## Additional Strategies

### Tracking Improvement

Signs your mental game is improving:

- Better recognition of patterns in real-time
- Controlling emotions while playing
- Making fewer poker mistakes
- Playing longer while battling problems
- Quitting faster (for right reasons)
- Recovering faster after bad sessions
- Your worst is better than before
- Recognizing new layers of problems

### Writing

Benefits:

- Builds recognition
- Speeds learning
- Makes thoughts concrete
- Creates reference records
- Frees up mental space
- Organizes issues
- Releases emotion

### Accumulated Emotion

When emotions have built up over long periods:

1. Take it seriously - expect slow improvement
2. Complete mental hand histories for each issue
3. Build recognition aggressively
4. Rewrite the past - analyze old memories
5. Learn from past experiences
6. Remove expectations it should be fixed already
7. Address subtle pieces of the problem
8. Consider professional help if needed

## Key Concepts

### Why Injecting Logic May Fail

- Emotional level already past threshold
- Statement not strong enough
- New mental game issue appeared
- Accumulated emotion overwhelmed you instantly
- Need voice recording instead

### Resolution Benefits

1. Frees mental space for better focus
2. Your best becomes even better
3. Emotions disappear permanently
4. Better play and more profit

### Important Notes

- Mental game problems happen for logical reasons
- Emotion is the symptom, not the cause
- Resolution means training corrections to Unconscious Competence
- Both strategies work together - containment now, resolution later
- Without resolution, you're just better at quitting, not better at the game

## Practical Applications

- Use injecting logic during play
- Work on resolution away from the table
- Combine with warm-up and evaluation routines
- Track progress with written notes
- Be patient - mastery takes time and repetition
