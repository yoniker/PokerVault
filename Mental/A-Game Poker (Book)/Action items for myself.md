1. Create a schedule - make it flexible. Freedom in poker isn't doing whatever whenever, but the freedom to decide consciously what to do, and how and when i want to allocate my time.
2. Networking, having players with the same mindset as me, is important. Top players usually have fellow players helping each other.
