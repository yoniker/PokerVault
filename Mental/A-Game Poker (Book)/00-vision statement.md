## I. Fulfill Potential (The Internal Work)
*My drive to evolve, master the game, and advance the world.*

*   **Constant Evolution:** I want to constantly improve and study to become an all-around absolute great.
*   **New Versions:** I want to feel as if every month there’s a new version of me that is getting better and better.
*   **Optimization:** I want to be healthy in both my mind and my body: fit, sharp, knowledgeable.
*   **Radical Purpose:** I want to have a purposeful and meaningful life at every step. Even when I have fun, I want to be purposeful and maximize fun rather than endlessly scrolling through social media or watching mediocre content.
*   **Global Impact:** I want to advance humanity and squash dark philosophies and beliefs that stop it from advancing.

## II. Create Happiness (The External Result)
*My drive to provide, experience freedom, and support my circle.*

*   **Presence:** I want to be there for my family and friends.
*   **Resources:** Be able to provide resources abundantly.
*   **Freedom:** I want to experience the world.
*   **Environment:** I don’t want to experience the Canadian winter anymore.

## The Decision Filter
*As per A-Game Poker Chapter 14: "Your vision is a state of being."*

When facing a decision or feeling resistance, ask:
**"Does this action help me Fulfill Potential or Create Happiness?"**

*   **Yes?** → Do it. (e.g., Studying solvers, hitting the gym, planning travel).
*   **No?** → Cut it. (e.g., Doomscrolling, playing tired, tilting).
