## Poker as a Professional Sport
The modern edge is found by treating poker like an elite sport. The days of the "unhealthy, partying grinder" are mostly over. 

**The Professional Approach:**
- **Optimization:** Every aspect of life (sleep, diet, focus) is geared toward table performance.
- **Evolution:** The game evolves rapidly. Players must evolve with it or get left behind (e.g., The transition from "feel" players to "solver" players).

## Off-The-Table Optimization (The Foundation)
Success requires a holistic approach. You cannot separate the human from the player.
1. **Time Management:** Conscious allocation of hours (Freedom = Choice, not laziness).
2. **Sleep:** The primary recovery tool for cognitive function.
3. **Fitness:** Physical stamina required for long sessions/focus.
4. **Nutrition:** Fuel for the brain to prevent decision fatigue.
5. **Recovery:** Active rest to prevent burnout.

## The A-Game Skill Stack (Chapter 10)
Being the "best" at technical poker isn't enough. High earners stack complementary skills on top of technical ability.

| Skill                   | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bankroll Management** | The lifeblood of the business. "The first rule is stay in action."                                                          |
| **Game Selection**      | The lever with the most leverage. Beating the players in front of you is more important than beating the best in the world. |
| **Networking**          | Poker is an individual game optimized by a team. (Sharing hands, emotional support, strategy groups).                       |
| **Skill Acquisition**   | The meta-skill of *how* you study. Efficient study > Volume of study.                                                       |

> [!NOTE] The "Skill Stack" Concept
> Just as Shohei Ohtani is valuable because he pitches *and* hits, or a CEO is valuable because they understand product *and* leadership, a poker player maximizes value by stacking these soft skills on top of technical theory.
