## Core Philosophy
The modern poker landscape has evolved. Strategic gaps are narrowing due to solvers and training sites. The new edge is **Performance**. 

> [!QUESTION] The Fundamental Performance Question
> "What are the best players in the world doing to be successful that I am not?"
>
> **The Process:** 
> 1. Identify what the best do.
> 2. Identify what you do.
> 3. **Close the Gap.**

## The Definition of A-Game
A-Game is not just "playing well" or "making money." It is defined as:
> **"Optimizing profits in a way that achieves your personal poker vision."**

## The Six Levers of Poker Profits (Chapter 5)
Most players focus only on Skill. Roe argues that profit is a system of **six interdependent levers**. If one is a bottleneck, profit stagnates regardless of how hard you pull the other levers.

1. **Skill:** Your absolute knowledge of the game (0–100).
    * *Correlates with:* Edge, Confidence, Ability to multitable.
2. **Edge:** The gap in skill between you and your opponents.
    * *Key Insight:* You don't need to be the best in the world; you need to be better than the person across from you.
3. **Efficiency:** The percentage of time you apply your full skill.
    * *The A-Game Metric:* How close is your *Applied Skill* to your *Potential Skill*? (e.g., Playing tired reduces efficiency).
4. **Volume:** How often you apply your skill for real money.
    * *Constraint:* High volume often lowers efficiency (fatigue/autopilot).
5. **Stakes:** The size of the games you play.
    * *Risk:* Moving up too fast destroys bankrolls; staying low caps income.
6. **Rake:** The cost of doing business.
    * *Note:* High rake can make low stakes games unbeatable regardless of skill.

> [!TIP] The Control Room Visualization
> Imagine your mind is a control room. If you only pull the "Skill" lever, it gets stuck. You must look around the room and adjust the other 5 levers (Game Select for Edge, Sleep for Efficiency, etc.) to move the "Profit" number.
