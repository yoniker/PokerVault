## Flop

BU can bet any two cards except underpair no spades and AQ no spade
## Turn

After flop went X/X, on a Ks turn when the BB leads, BU only calls and never raises.

After flop went X/B30/C, on a 5s, BU likes to bet his gutshots,OESD, one spade hand, and some air.

## River

On 3c5s runout when action checked through, A7/A5 pure call (unlike other 5x and 7x) - i guess because they block BB's check SDV range.

On 6789 and flush board, even 99 doesn't go for value.
