Study date: 5-July

The goal of this masterclass is to optimize my study routine to get the maximum out of every hour spent studying. In this session we're going to answer 'how' (not 'what' or 'when').

Goal of studying: -Increase the gap between me and my opponents, grow love for the game.

## Growth mindset

Growth mindset: A famous experiment on **growth mindset** is Carol Dweck‚Äôs **7th-grade math study (1998)**.

She and her team divided students into two groups:

- One group was taught study skills **plus lessons about how intelligence can grow with effort (growth mindset)**. the **growth mindset group** was explicitly taught:

‚úÖ **The brain is like a muscle:** it gets stronger and forms new connections when you practice and challenge yourself.  
‚úÖ **Neuroscience evidence:** learning actually changes the brain and increases intelligence.  
‚úÖ **Effort and strategies matter:** success comes from persistence, trying different approaches, and learning from mistakes ‚Äî not from fixed talent.
    
- The other group was taught only study skills.
    

Result: The growth mindset group showed significantly higher improvement in math grades over time, while the control group did not improve.

It demonstrated that believing intelligence is malleable fosters motivation, resilience, and academic achievement.

eg I don't understand why this happens in solver world YET. I will gain the ability eventually. I'm not running good - it's an opportunity for prove to myself that I can handle it ,etc. Basically, approaching every challange in a positive, growth mindset way.

Holding the view that talent can't be trained will be a liability at the first bump encountered. And every significant path, especially something as tough as poker, has many bumps.

How to have growth mindset: as an exercise, every time i face adversity, take a step back, and reframe that adversity in a positive,growth mindset,way.

## Deliberate Practice 
The **Steve Falloon experiment** is a famous single-case study in cognitive psychology by **Eric K. Ericcson, Walter Kintsch, and colleagues (1980)** that demonstrated how deliberate practice and chunking can dramatically increase a person‚Äôs memory performance.

### üìã **Summary of the experiment:**

- **Subject:** Steve Falloon, a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate, volunteered for a study on memory span.
    
- **Task:** Recall as many random digits as possible, presented at a rate of 1 per second.
    
- **Initial performance:** Like most people, Steve‚Äôs digit span was about **7 ¬± 2 digits** at the start. He stayed in the **10‚Äì11 digit range for roughly 5‚Äì10** sessions.
    
- **Training:** Over **more than 200 sessions spanning 2 years**, Steve practiced the digit span task for about 1 hour at a time.
    
- **Outcome:**
    
    - By the end, he could reliably recall strings of **80+ digits**, an extraordinary improvement.
        
    - His ability to remember random digits was not due to a general increase in memory capacity, but to **chunking strategies**.



In spelling bee research (Duckworth et al., 2015), **deliberate practice (DP)** ‚Äî _targeted, effortful study focused on word origins, patterns, and rules, designed to address weaknesses and improve specific skills_ ‚Äî was the strongest predictor of success.

üìå Simply reading or rote memorizing long word lists was less effective.

üìå- **Time spent on deliberate practice & Bee performance**:  
    **r ‚âà +0.38**  
    (moderately strong positive correlation: more time doing DP ‚Üí better ranking)
    
- **Time spent reading for pleasure & Bee performance**:  
    **r ‚âà ‚Äì0.22**  
    (negative correlation: more general reading ‚Üí worse ranking)
    
- **Time spent memorizing word lists & Bee performance**:  
    **r ‚âà +0.13**  
    (small positive correlation, much weaker than DP)
    

### üß© Interpretation:

‚úÖ _Time spent does matter ‚Äî but only if that time is spent on the right method (DP)._  
‚úÖ Method choice (DP vs. others) explains much more of the variance in success than raw hours alone.  
‚úÖ In their regression models, DP time remained a significant predictor of success even after controlling for IQ, verbal ability, and prior experience.

So:

- The **type of study** (DP) had the largest impact on success.
    
- **Time on task helped only when that time was deliberate, not general.**
On average the spellers found deliberate practice more effortful and far less enjoyable than other activities. 


### Deliberate practice in poker

Step 1. Identify a leak that I have. Break it into the smallest possible sub-skill

Step 2. **Specific goals**  
Not just ‚Äúget better,‚Äù but ‚Äúimprove c-bet frequencies on paired boards in SRP BU vs BB,‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn how to defend vs turn overbets in 3-bet pots.‚Äù

Step 3. Study the specific area in my game with high intensity, focusing on the mistakes I'm making while getting expert feedback from my environment

Step 4. Rinse and repeat


Example:

1. Leak : Overfolding vs c-bets. Since there are tons of contexts of c-bets (facing a huge c-bet on a 4-bet pot vs facing a B30 in a wide configuration like BU vs BB),pick one context (probably the most frequent one/the one I leak most money in). So for example- as BB vs BU SRP facing B30 on the flop.

2. Train in GTOW and either train until I get 15 right in a row, or set a new personal record

3. Do the exercise with intensity as if I'm studying for an important exam. When I make a mistake, I'll provide as much context as possible
