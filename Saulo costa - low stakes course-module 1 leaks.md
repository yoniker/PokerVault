I have to APPLY what Saulo will teach me. simply watching videos won't improve my game.
Set intentions in my play sessions to implement what I learn. Make SMALL,CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS and not try to implement a few things at once. One step at a time.

There are recommended stats (for example, flop aggression, X/R frequency etc).
The low end of the recommended agressive stats are taken from a solver, and the high end from exploitative players playing at Saulo's stable. The average is the frequency of strong high stakes players like Linus.

When the stat being considered is a folding stat the logic flips, where good players at the stable are the low end, GTO in between and high stakes players the most.


## 1.Preflop ranges

10NL players play preflop way too tight, opening way less than the range they should. In fact, Saulo thinks that the GTO ranges are already too tight, as I can develop a postflop edge and so play even more hands compared to GTO.
